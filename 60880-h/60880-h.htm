 PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE great affection with which my dear Sister has ever been regarded in
this country, and the universal feeling of sympathy shown at the time of
her death, lead me to hope that the publication of this volume may not
be unwelcome, containing as it does extracts from her letters to my
Mother, together with a brief record of her married life.</p>

<p>The short Memoir here translated from the German, with which the letters
are interwoven, was written, as will be seen at a glance, not as
presenting any thing like a complete picture of my Sister’s character
and opinions, but merely as a narrative of such of the incidents of her
life as were necessary to illustrate and explain the letters themselves.</p>

<p>In these days, when the custom has become general of publishing
biographies of all persons of note or distinction, it was thought
advisable, in order that a true picture might be given of my Sister,
that a short sketch of her life should be prepared by some one who was
personally known to her, and who appreciated the many beautiful features
of her char<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span>acter. The choice fell upon a clergyman at Darmstadt, Dr.
Sell.</p>

<p>It would have been premature and out of place to attempt any thing like
a complete picture of a character so many-sided, or of my Sister’s
opinions on the affairs of Europe, in which she took the deepest
interest, and on which she formed opinions remarkable for breadth and
sagacity of view. The domestic side of her nature might alone for the
present be freely dealt with; and to help Dr. Sell in delineating this,
my Mother selected for his guidance the extracts from my Sister’s
letters to her which appear in the present volume. There was no thought
at first of making these extracts public, but they were found to be so
beautiful, and to be so true an expression of what my Sister really was,
that, in compliance with the request of the Grand Duke her husband, they
were allowed to be translated and published, so that her subjects might
see in them how great reason they had to love her whom they had lost.</p>

<p>The letters in their original form are here given to the English public,
and I am sure that all who read them will feel thankful to my Mother for
thus granting them a closer insight into my clear Sister’s beautiful and
unselfish life.</p>

<p>They will see in them also, with satisfaction, how devoted she was to
the land of her birth,&mdash;how her heart ever turned to it with reverence
and affection as the country which had done and was doing for Liberty
and the advancement of mankind more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span> than any other country in the
world. How deep was her feeling in this respect was testified by a
request, which she made to her husband in anticipation of her death,
that an English flag might be laid upon her coffin; accompanying the
wish with a modest expression of a hope, that no one in the land of her
adoption could take umbrage at her desire to be borne to her rest with
the old English colors above her.</p>

<p>In any case I feel confident that the perusal of these letters must
deepen the love and admiration which have always been felt for my
beloved Sister in this country, where she ever thanked God that her
childhood and youth had been tended with a wise love, that had fostered
and developed all those qualities and tastes which she most valued and
strove to cultivate in her later years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had written these words, when another beloved member of our family,
whose name often recurs in my Sister’s letters, was suddenly taken from
us, and from our country. Writing of my dear Brother to my Mother
(February 1, 1868) she said: “May God spare that young bright and gifted
life to be a comfort to you for many a year to come!” That life, which
then hung trembling in the balance, was mercifully spared, not indeed
for many a year, but long enough to make my Brother more beloved by his
family and friends, and to enable him to give to his country some token
of the good gifts with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> which he was endowed. As he was the last of us
to see my dear Sister in life, so he has been the first to follow her
into the Silent Land.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="sml">“I ever look back to my childhood and girlhood as the happiest time
of life.”&mdash;(<i>13th June, 1869.</i>)</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">P</span>RINCESS ALICE, as she is ever called in England, was born at Buckingham
Palace on the 25th of April, 1843. She was the third child and second
daughter of Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince Consort. At her
christening, which took place at the Palace on the 2d of June, she
received the names of Alice Maud Mary. Princess Sophia Matilda of
Gloucester, niece of King George III., and sister-in-law to the Duchess
of Gloucester, was one of her godmothers, and her Royal parents chose
the name of Maud, which is the same as Matilda, on account of its being
an old English name borne by the Empress Maud, and other British
princesses. The name of “Mary” was chosen because the little princess
was born on the Duchess of Gloucester’s birthday.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury officiated at the christening. The
sponsors: the reigning King<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span> of Hanover, Ernest Augustus; the Hereditary
Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; Princess Sophia Matilda of Gloucester,
sister-in-law to the Duchess of Gloucester, niece of George III.; and
Feodora, Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, half-sister to the Queen.</p>

<p>The christening was, as the Queen herself told her uncle, the King of
the Belgians, when writing to him on the 6th of June, “a very imposing
ceremony. Nothing could have gone off better, and little Alice behaved
extremely well.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Though twenty-two years only have passed since the wholly unexpected
death of Prince Albert deprived the Queen of her devoted husband, the
Royal children of a most loving and beloved father, and the whole nation
of one of its wisest counsellors, his life, in the admirable
biographical memorial by Sir Theodore Martin, forms already part of
history, and by it we are enabled to form a just estimate of the perfect
character and great intellectual abilities of the Prince, whom his
daughter, Princess Alice, revered through life as her highest ideal.</p>

<p>Prince Albert, the second son of the then reigning Duke of Coburg, was
the very picture of manly chivalrous beauty. He was very young, not yet
twenty-one years old, when he became the Consort of the Queen of
England, who was only three months older. But by his strength of
character and rare energy of intellect, combined with a thorough
self-con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span>trol and an unswerving devotion to the duties of his position,
he succeeded in gaining the love and esteem of a nation which, though it
keeps watch over its rights and privileges with peculiar jealousy, knows
also how to show great generosity, when once it has learnt to trust and
to love.</p>

<p>With his wonderful power of mastering new and difficult subjects he made
himself familiar with the history and policy, the social and
agricultural conditions, the industries and commercial relations of his
adopted country. In his position of intimate confidential adviser to the
Sovereign he showed the greatest tact, and gained the affection and
respect of the Ministers who succeeded one another at the head of
affairs; whilst the more he became known the more his genuine worth was
appreciated by the nation at large.</p>

<p>Chief of all, two nations have acknowledged with grateful admiration,
that under his influence there grew up in the midst of the most
brilliant Court in Europe a domestic family life, so perfect in its
purity and charm that it might well serve for a bright example to every
home in the land. Whilst sharing with the Sovereign all the labors and
cares of state, the Prince made suitable changes and practical
arrangements in the Royal Household, and, by steadily adhering to
principles which he had at once recognized as the best, he succeeded in
making life happy and peaceful to all around him. Thus it was that the
Royal Family of England, whether residing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span> the splendid palaces at
Windsor, in London, or at Osborne, the lovely country seat in the Isle
of Wight, or at Balmoral, surrounded by the sterner scenery of the
Scotch Highlands, was enabled to enjoy a life of perfect tranquillity
amidst the political tempests of the most turbulent decade of our times.</p>

<p>The childhood of the Princess Alice was a very happy one, and much
favored by circumstances. When she was a year old, her father mentioned
her as “the beauty of the family,” and as an extremely good and merry
child. Her mother adds, “she was a very vain little person.”</p>

<p>She developed naturally. At first she was not thought to be so highly
gifted as later years proved her to be. Her father often used to speak
of her as “poor dear little Alice,” as if he had to take her part. She
soon became a great favorite with all around her. Lady Lyttleton, who up
to 1851 was entrusted with the supervision of the Royal children, and to
whose pen we owe so many accounts of that happy family life, writes as
follows on the little Princess’ fourth birthday:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Dear Princess Alice is too pretty, in her low frock and pearl
necklace, tripping about and blushing and smiling at her honors.
The whole family, indeed, appear to advantage on birthdays; no
tradesman or country squire can keep one with such hearty simple
affection and enjoyment. <i>One</i> present I think we shall all wish to
live farther off: a live lamb, all over pink ribbons and bells. He
is already the greatest pet, as one may suppose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span></p>

<p>“Princess Alice’s pet lamb is the cause of many tears. He will not
take to his mistress, but runs away lustily, and will soon butt at
her, though she is most coaxy, and said to him in her sweetest
tones, after kissing his nose often, ‘Milly, <i>dear</i> Milly! <i>do</i> you
like me?’<span class="lftspc">”</span></p></div>

<p>One of the main principles observed in the education of the Royal
children was this&mdash;that though they received the best training, of body
and mind, to fit them for the high position they would eventually have
to fill, they should in nowise come in contact with the actual Court
life. The children were scarcely known to the Queen’s ladies-in-waiting,
as they only now and then made their appearance for a moment after
dinner at dessert, or accompanied their parents out driving. The care of
them was exclusively entrusted to persons who possessed the Queen and
Prince Consort’s entire confidence, and with whom they could at all
times communicate direct. The Royal parents kept themselves thoroughly
informed of the minutest detail of what was being done for their
children in the way of training and instruction.</p>

<p>After the first years of childhood were past, the Royal children were
placed under the care of English, French, and German governesses, who,
again, were under a Lady Superintendent, and accompanied the children in
their walks and watched over them during their games.</p>

<p>To the lessons in foreign languages, music and drawing were soon added,
for which the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span> Princess showed a decided talent.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> “Her copybooks
were always neatness itself, and she wrote a very pretty hand.” “Fresh,
blooming, and healthy, escaping most of the illnesses of childhood,
cheerful, merry, full of fun and mischief,” she delighted in all bodily
exercises, such as gymnastics, skating, etc. Above all, she was
passionately fond of riding and of horses. She preferred playing with
her brothers, and was bold and fearless as a boy. With all this,
however, she soon showed proofs of real kindness of heart and of tender
consideration for others. “I remember well,” a former dresser of the
Queen’s relates, “meeting the Royal children playing in the corridor,
and, as I passed on, the Prince of Wales making a joke about my great
height, the Princess said to her brothers, but so that I should hear it:
‘It is very nice to be tall; Papa would like us all to be tall.’<span class="lftspc">”</span> “Her
kindness of heart showed itself in all her actions when a child.
Whenever she in the least suspected that anybody’s feelings had been
hurt, she always tried to make things smooth again.” “At Christmastime
she was most anxious to give pleasure to everybody, and bought presents
for each with her own pocket-money. She once gave me a little
pincushion, and on another occasion a basket, and wrote on a little card
with a colored border (always in German for me) ‘For dear Frida [now
Madame Müller], from Alice’ and brought it to me herself on Christmas
Eve. I felt that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span> thought how much I must have missed my home
that day.”</p>

<p>The, first journeys on which she, with her elder sister and brother, was
allowed to accompany her parents are vividly described in the Queen’s
Journal. They were those to Ireland, in 1849, and, in 1850, to the
Highlands; and to the beauty and grandeur of Highland scenery she
remained through life an enthusiastic devotee.</p>

<p>Her intellectual faculties and the deeper qualities of her character did
not, in her case, as, indeed, generally happens with high-spirited,
healthy children, develop very early; but almost from the first she
showed those qualities of disposition which win all hearts and lend a
charm to daily life.</p>

<p>Little theatrical pieces performed by the Royal children on festive
anniversaries in the family&mdash;partly, too, with a view of gaining
facility in foreign languages&mdash;were the field in which the young
Princess decidedly distinguished herself. No child ever performed the
part of the High Priest Joad in Racine’s “Athalie,” with more dignity,
and with a more pleasing intonation; and a more delightful German Red
Ridinghood<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> than the Princess never appeared upon the stage.</p>

<p>Of one of these performances, given in honor of the Queen and Prince’s
wedding-day in 1864, Baroness Bunsen gives the following description in
her biography of Baron Bunsen. A tableau represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span>ing the Four Seasons
had been studied and contrived by the Royal children. “First appeared
Princess Alice as the Spring, scattering flowers, and reciting verses,
which were taken from Thomson’s ‘Seasons’; she moved gracefully, and
spoke in a distinct and pleasing manner with excellent modulation, and a
tone of voice sweet and penetrating like that of the Queen.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It was during these years that Princess Alice formed her warm friendship
for the Princess Louise of Prussia, now Grand Duchess of Baden, who
records her first impressions of the young Princess in the following
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“She was at that time most graceful in appearance&mdash;charming, merry,
and amiable; and though always occupying a subordinate place to her
very gifted and distinguished sister, there never was the least
semblance of a disagreement. Alice’s cheerful disposition and her
great power of observation showed themselves very early in the
pleasantest manner, and she had a remarkable gift of making herself
attractive to others. Her individuality was less decided and
prominent than that of her sister, and she had a special charm of
childhood grace. Our walks and drives together, the life in the
schoolroom, the games in the corridors, or in dear old Baron
Stockmar’s room&mdash;these and all the pleasure and enjoyment of being
together with the two sisters will ever remain amongst the happiest
and most lasting of my recollections.”</p></div>

<p>The opening of the First Great Exhibition in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span> 1851&mdash;Prince Albert’s own
creation&mdash;was the occasion of a visit of the Prince of Prussia (the
present Emperor of Germany) and his family to the English Court. This
visit was repeated in 1853. Meanwhile an active correspondence had
sprung up between the young friends, in which Princess Alice took a most
active part.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Alice was now drawn more into the circle of the grown-up members
of the family; but, in spite of this, she retained all the
fascination of her charming graceful ways. A great vein of humor
showed itself in her, as well as a certain sharpness in criticising
people who were not congenial to her. Many a little conflict took
place in the schoolroom; but while the individualities of the
sisters became more and more distinct, their happy relations to one
another remained unchanged. She was a great favorite with her
brothers and sisters, though they knew she was fond of mischief.</p>

<p>“To a naturally engaging manner quite exceptional joyousness and
power of showing affectionate emotion imparted an especial charm,
which revealed itself in the fine lines of her face, in her
graceful movements, and a certain inborn nobleness and dignity. Her
attachment to my parents, ‘Uncle Prussia’ and ‘Aunt Prussia,’ was
truly touching.”</p></div>

<p>In 1855 Princess Alice had her first serious illness&mdash;scarlet
fever&mdash;caught from her younger sister, Princess Louise. She recovered
easily, but for some time afterward a certain delicacy was observable.
The accounts at that time are unanimous in describing the peculiarly
sweet development of her disposi<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span>tion, and the manifestation of a true
womanly interest in the works of charity and mercy. The feeling of
acting independently for the good of others had been aroused in many
ways in the Royal children. The Swiss Cottage at Osborne, in like
manner, with its museum, kitchen, store-room, and little gardens, was
made the means of learning how to do household work, and to direct the
management of a small establishment.</p>

<p>The parents were invited there as guests, to partake of the dishes which
the Princesses themselves prepared; and there, too, each child was
allowed to choose its own occupation, and to enjoy perfect liberty.</p>

<p>The life in the Highlands, free from the restraint of Court life,
brought the Royal children into closer contact with the humbler classes,
and called into play their sympathies for the poor.</p>

<p>They were permitted to visit the humblest cottages&mdash;nay, even encouraged
to do so. There it was, no doubt, that a feeling of pity for and an
ardent desire to help the poor, the sick, and the needy, were first
aroused in the Princess. We know how these early impressions led in
later life to her founding some of the noblest and most beneficent
institutions.</p>

<p>The blessings of a happy family life,&mdash;which generally those only are
allowed to enjoy who live in happy obscurity from the great world,&mdash;were
fully appreciated by the Princess, as we may see from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span> later
letters, abounding in gratitude to her parents and brothers and sisters,
and from the frequent references which she makes to this period of her
life.</p>

<p>The visits of the grandchildren to their beloved grandmother, the
Duchess of Kent, old in years but young in spirit, at her residences at
Frogmore (near Windsor), and Abergeldie (near Balmoral), had a peculiar
charm for them.</p>

<p>The first excursion the Princess made out of her native land was to
Cherbourg,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> when, with her brothers and sisters, she accompanied her
parents. The lovely scenery about Cherbourg has become familiar to us
through the descriptions given by the Queen.</p>

<p>A great change in the life of the Princess took place through the
engagement of the Princess Royal to Prince Frederick William of Prussia.
Hitherto the Princess had in a great measure shared her sister’s studies
and artistic occupations, and had had the same companions, taking
quietly and naturally the second place. Now her sister’s departure for a
new home wrought an entire change in her life, throwing upon her, as it
did, new responsibilities as now the eldest daughter at home, and
placing her in a new position in relation to her parents, and
particularly to her father, whose constant care it was to imbue her with
that sincerity and earnestness of purpose without which, to use his
friend Baron<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span> Stockmar’s words, “it was impossible to fill one’s
position in life happily, worthily, and with dignity.”</p>

<p>The closer intercourse with her father laid the foundation of that deep
and intelligent love of plastic art and of music, for which she had
already as a child shown a decided talent. Her appreciation of all that
was best in the arts was fostered by the many treasures by which she was
surrounded at Windsor Castle, and also by prosecuting her studies and
practice in music along with the Prince Consort.</p>

<p>The many great and stirring events of those years, the disturbance of
Europe through the Revolutions of 1848 and 1849, and the Crimean war,
took place when the Princess was already old enough to feel their
gravity; and served to awaken and foster the keen interest which she
took in later years in all political occurrences.</p>

<p>Another great European conflict was approaching, just about the time of
her Confirmation, which took place on the 21st of April, 1869. Besides
having been prepared for it by the Dean of Windsor (the Hon. and Very
Rev. G. Wellesley), the Prince Consort himself had given the Princess
instructions, as he had previously done to the Princess Royal, from “A
manual of Religion and of the History of the Christian Church,” by Carl
Gottlieb Bretschneider (formerly, “General Superintendent” in Gotha).
The Prince’s object in this was to encourage her in serious thought, and
in independent reflections on religious questions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<p>The ceremony of the Confirmation, which was performed by the Archbishop
of Canterbury, had barely been concluded, when the news arrived of the
threatened invasion of Sardinia by Austria, which finally ended in the
Austro-Italian war, so disastrous to Austria, of 1859.</p>

<p>The Queen makes the following remarks on this event, in a letter to her
uncle, the King of the Belgians:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;But this did not in the least disturb our dear child’s
equanimity. She was in a most devotional state of mind&mdash;quiet,
gentle, self-possessed, and deeply impressed by the importance and
solemnity of the event. She answered admirably at her examination,
and went through the ceremony in a very perfect manner.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></div>

<p>Not long before this the Queen had given her own opinion of her daughter
in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“She is very good, gentle, sensible, and amiable, and a real
comfort to me. I shall not let her marry as long as I can
reasonably delay her doing so.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></div>

<p>In June 1860 the Queen and Prince Consort received numerous guests at
Windsor Castle for the Ascot races, amongst others the King of the
Belgians and the two Princes, Louis and Henry of Hesse, the sons of
Prince Charles of Hesse and nephews of the reigning Grand Duke. After
they had left England, the Prince Consort mentioned to his valued friend
Baron Stockmar, that there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span> no doubt that Prince Louis and Princess
Alice had formed a mutual liking, and that he quite expected it would
lead to further advances from the young Prince’s family.</p>

<p>Judging by the favorable impression which the manly and attractive
Prince of twenty-three had made, the probable result was eagerly looked
for.</p>

<p>Before long a letter from Princess Frederick William from Berlin
announced that she had been in communication with Prince Louis’ mother,
Princess Charles of Hesse (cousin of the Prince Regent of Prussia), who
had informed her of her son’s great admiration for her sister. It was
arranged that, after the journey of the Queen and Prince Consort to
Germany that autumn, the young Prince should pay a second visit to
England; and leave of absence for him was to be obtained from the Prince
Regent of Prussia.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This was done, and he arrived at Windsor Castle in
November. On the 30th of November the Queen wrote as follows in her
Diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;After dinner, whilst talking to the gentlemen, I perceived
Alice and Louis talking before the fireplace more earnestly than
usual, and when I passed to go to the other room, both came up to
me, and Alice in much agitation said he had proposed to her, and he
begged for my blessing. I could only squeeze his hand and say
‘Certainly.’ and that we would see him in our room later. Got<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span>
through the evening working as well as we could. Alice came to our
room *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;agitated, but quiet. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Albert sent for Louis to his
room; he went first to him and then called Alice and me in. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Louis has a warm, noble heart. We embraced our dear Alice, and
praised her much to him. He pressed and kissed my hand, and I
embraced him. After talking a little, we parted; a most touching,
and to me most sacred, moment.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></div>

<p>As this was entirely a marriage of affection, the happiness of the
“young people” was very great.</p>

<p>Prince Louis stayed over Christmas, which this year seemed brighter to
the whole family, from the accession of what her father termed “a
beloved newly-bestowed full-grown son.” “Our dear Bridegroom,” as the
Prince Consort calls the young Prince, left on the 28th of December. The
parting was tearful, but full of hope, as he was to return in the
spring.</p>

<p>During the first happy weeks after her engagement, Princess Alice had
spent the greater part of her evenings with her beloved grandmother, the
Duchess of Kent, either reading or playing on the piano to her, as the
Duchess’ health did not allow of her dining at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>The Duchess’ condition had become worse during the first months of the
new year (1861), and she died on the 16th of March at the age of
seventy-four, in the presence of her beloved and loving daughter, whose
happiness and affection had been the joy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> her life, and also of her
equally beloved son-in-law, and the Princess Alice. On this sad
occasion, which she felt most deeply, Princess Alice showed the comfort
and help she was fitted to be to her family in times of sorrow and
anxiety.</p>

<p>The Queen communicated to Parliament in a “Message” the contemplated
marriage of the Princess. The announcement was received with general
satisfaction. When, shortly afterward, the question of the Princess’
“settlement” was laid before the House of Commons, the dowry of
30,000<i>l.</i>, with an annuity of 6,000<i>l.</i>, was voted without a
dissentient voice. “She will not,” writes her careful father, “be able
to do great things with it.”</p>

<p>In May, Prince Louis arrived at Osborne on a visit. Soon after, however,
he fell ill with the measles. Prince Leopold caught them from him, and
was very seriously ill.</p>

<p>In the following month the whole family were for the last time together,
including the two sons-in-law<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the two grandchildren from
Potsdam.</p>

<p>Prince Louis paid another visit to England in September, when he took
part in those delightful expeditions in the Highlands, which were to be
the last the Prince Consort made.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>In December, in the midst of preparations which he was making for
Princess Alice’s future household, and for a journey of her brother,
Prince Leopold, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> Cannes, the Prince Consort fell ill. Princess Alice
was often with her father during his illness, reading to him, and in
intimate communication with her mother. Soon, however, the illness
developed into low fever, and the Prince, worn out by over-work and
anxiety, had not strength to resist it, and died peacefully on the 14th
of December, in the presence of the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and the
Princesses Alice and Hélèna. During the days of unspeakable sorrow which
followed upon the death of the Prince Consort, it was Princess Alice
above all who was a real support to her broken-hearted mother. The
unanimous opinion of eye-witnesses as to what the Princess went through
and achieved at this time is truly astonishing.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Herself filled with the intensest sorrow at her beloved father’s
death&mdash;and what a father! what a head of a family! what a friend
and adviser to his wife and children!&mdash;she at once took into her
own hands every thing that was necessary in those first dark days
of the destruction of that happy home. All communications from the
Ministers and household passed through the Princess’ hands to the
Queen, then bowed down by grief. She endeavored in every way
possible, either verbally or by writing, to save her mother all
trouble. The decision to leave Windsor for Osborne directly after
the Prince’s death, according to the urgent wish of the King of the
Belgians, and which it was so difficult and painful for the Queen
to make, was obtained by the Princess’ influence.”</p></div>

<p>The gay, bright girl seemed all at once to have changed into the
thoughtful woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It was the very intimate intercourse with the sorrowing Oueen at
that time which called forth in Princess Alice that keen interest
and understanding in politics for which she was afterward so
distinguished. She also gained at this time that practical
knowledge for organizing, and the desire for constant occupation,
which in her public as well as in her private life became part of
herself. The Princess suddenly developed into a wise far-seeing
woman, living only for others, and beloved and respected by the
highest as well as by the lowest.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p></div>

<p>It was at this time that the <i>Times</i> said of the Princess:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It is impossible to speak too highly of the strength of mind and
self-sacrifice of the Princess Alice during these dreadful days.
Her Royal Highness has certainly understood, that it was her duty
to be the help and support of her mother in her great sorrow, and
it was in a great measure due to her that the Queen has been able
to bear with such wonderful resignation the irreparable loss that
so suddenly and terribly befell her.”</p></div>

<p>The young “bridegroom” did not remain absent in those days, but arrived
without delay.</p>

<p>A touching trait is told by the same near relation of the Princess whose
memorandum has just been quoted. As she was placing wreaths and flowers
on the dear dead Prince, and both knelt down near him, she said in a
heart-rending voice, “Oh! dear Molly, let us pray to God to give us back
dear Papa!”</p>

<p>The letters published in this volume will show<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span> that the feeling of that
irreparable loss never left her through life, and our impression cannot
be a false one, that it was this loss which brought out the deep
earnestness of her character, and which made her feel that life was no
light thing, but a time of probation to be spent in earnest work and
conscientious fulfilment of duty.</p>

<p>She felt it to be a sacred duty to foster the recollections of her
girlhood, and to carry out the principles with which her father had
embued her, whether in the cultivation of art and science, the
encouragement of art manufactures, of agriculture and general education,
in the tasteful and practical arrangement of her own house, in bettering
the conditions of the lower and working classes by improving their homes
and inculcating principles of health, economy, and domestic management.
In short, in every way open to her, did the Princess try to walk in her
father’s footsteps, and so to do honor to his memory.</p>

<p>It is but natural that during the first weeks of her first great sorrow,
and of her many new duties, the thought of her own future should have
been put into the background. The preparations for her marriage,
however, as well as for her household were continued, according to the
known intentions of the Prince Consort. The marriage was solemnized at
Osborne on the 1st of July at one o’clock. The Archbishop of York
performed the ceremony in the absence of the Archbishop of Canterbury,
who was prevented by illness from being present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<p>Besides her sorrowing mother, the Crown Prince of Prussia, all her
brothers and sisters, the parents and brothers and sisters of the
bridegroom, and a number of princely relations were present. The Duke of
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, in the place of her father, led the bride to the
altar, whilst the bridegroom was accompanied by his brother, Prince
Henry. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the Queen withdrew to her
room. The guests left the Isle of Wight in the afternoon, whilst the
newly-married pair went with a small suit to St. Clare, near Ryde
(belonging to Colonel and Lady Catherine Harcourt), where they remained
three days.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July, Prince and Princess Louis of Hesse left England,
accompanied by the fervent prayers and good wishes of a devoted people,
who never forgot what their Princess had been to them in their hour of
trouble.</p>

<p>What they felt found apt expression in the following sonnet, which
appeared in <i>Punch</i> at the time:</p>

 IN HER NEW HOME.<br /><br />
1862-1865.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="sml">“Our life is a very, very happy one. I have nothing on earth to
wish for.... To be able to make a bright and comfortable home for
my dear husband is my constant aim.”&mdash;(<i>14th Feb.-1st March,

<h3><a name="yr-1862" id="yr-1862">1862</a>.</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">M</span>EANWHILE sorrow had fallen on the Grand Ducal family of Hesse also.
Some weeks before the Princess’ marriage (May 25), the Grand Duchess of
Hesse (Princess of Bavaria) had died&mdash;a woman beloved for her amiable
and generous qualities, deeply regretted by her husband, the Grand Duke
Louis III., and mourned by all who knew her, high as well as low.
Nevertheless, preparations had been made to give a brilliant reception
to the newly-married pair. The whole country looked forward with anxiety
to the arrival of the young Princess, of whom so much had been heard,
and who, though English, was known to have a thoroughly sympathetic
feeling for Germany.</p>

<p>The Prince and Princess made a short stay at Brussels, and arrived at
Bingen, on the Hessian frontier, on the 12th of July.</p>

<p>A special train took them on to Mayence, where the first official
reception took place. The Rhine<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> was crossed in a gaily-decorated
steamer, and at the last station before Darmstadt the Grand Duke and all
the family received the Prince and Princess and accompanied them to
Darmstadt.</p>

<p>At half-past four in the afternoon the young married couple made their
state entry into the town, through streets decorated with triumphal
arches, flags, and flowers, amidst the peals of bells and the
enthusiastic cheers of the assembled crowds, receiving and acknowledging
the many marks of respect and affection with which they were greeted.</p>

<p>A mounted guard of honor headed the procession. The schools, the
different guilds, the choral societies, the Turnvereine (gymnastic
societies), and thousands of town and country folk lined the streets
through which the Prince and Princess passed.</p>

<p>The impression produced on every one by the young Princess’ grace and
sweet maidenly beauty, and bright winning, yet truly dignified, manner,
was very great, and inspired the fairest hopes of what she would prove
in her new home. What her own first impressions of that home were are
given in the letters which follow.</p>

<p>The circumstances of her new life were certainly very different from
those to which she had been accustomed as an English Princess. What she
may have felt more keenly, as time went on, in the small but
often-recurring differences between English and German life, did not
oppress her at first. She had determined to make herself at home in her
husban<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span>d’s country, and she soon contrived to stamp on every room in her
house the impress of her fine taste. That house was of the most
unpretending character, situated in a quiet quarter of the town, near
the palace of Prince and Princess Charles of Hesse. They had few
servants besides those who came with them from England.</p>

<p>A short visit to her uncle at Coburg, a lengthened stay at
Auerbach,&mdash;where the Prince and Princess had a small country house lent
them by the Grand Duke,&mdash;and excursions to Heidelberg and Carlsruhe,
occupied the Summer months. In September they went to Rheinhardtsbrunn
in Thuringia to meet the Queen, and it was then settled that they should
spend the winter and spring in England with Her Majesty. The house the
Prince and Princess were living in at Darmstadt was so small, that plans
had at once to be made for a new palace of their own.</p>

<p>On the 10th of November they left Darmstadt, travelling by Coblenz and
Cologne to Antwerp. Here the Queen’s yacht, “Victoria and Albert”,
awaited them, and brought them to England, where they met with a most
hearty reception from all classes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Royal Yacht</span>, July 9th.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Mama</span>:&mdash;Before leaving the yacht I must send you a few lines
to wish you once more good-bye, and to thank you again and again
for all your kindness to us.</p>

<p>My heart was very full when I took leave of you and all the dear
ones at home; I had not the courage to say a word,&mdash;but your loving
heart understands what I felt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, July 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday, after we reached Bingen, all the Hessian officers of
state received us. At every station we received fresh people, and
had to speak to them. At Mayence also, the beautiful Austrian band
played whilst we waited, in pouring rain, which only ceased as we
reached Darmstadt. The station before, the Grand Duke, Prince and
Princess Charles with their children, Prince Alexander and his
wife, received us&mdash;all most kind and cordial.</p>

<p>At the station we were again received; the whole town so prettily
decked out; the Bürger [Burgesses Escort] rode near our carriage;
countless young ladies in white, and all so kind, so loyal; in all
the speeches kind and touching allusions were made to you, and to
our deep grief. I believe the people never gave so hearty a
welcome. We two drove through the town; incessant cheering and
showering of flowers. We got out at Prince and Princess Charles’
house, where the whole family was assembled.</p>

<p>We then went to our rooms, which are very small, but so prettily
arranged, with such perfect taste, all by my own dear Louis; they
look quite English.</p>

<p>We then drove to Bessungen for dinner <i>en famille</i>. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>We were listening to twelve Sängervereine [Choral Unions] singing
together yesterday evening&mdash;two hundred people; it was most
beautiful, but in pouring rain. Some came up-stairs dripping to
speak to us. The Grand Duke gave me a fine diamond bracelet he and
his wife had ordered for me, and showed me all over his rooms.</p>

<p>To-morrow we receive the Ständesherren [Princes and Counts] and the
gentlemen of both Houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span></p>

<p><i>My</i> thoughts, rather <i>our</i> thoughts, are constantly with you,
beloved Mama. Please give my love to all at home; it is impossible
to write to them all.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
July 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is extremely hot here. The last two days we rode out at
eight in the morning in the wood, where the air is very pleasant,
near the ground where the troops are drilled. On Monday we looked
on, and the soldiers were so much flattered.</p>

<p>At half-past one on Monday we received the gentlemen of the Upper
House, then the Lower House, then the Flügeladjutanten
[aides-de-camp], then the Stadtvorstand [Town Council], then about
seventy officers, then a deputation of the English here. All these
people I had to speak to <i>en grande toilette</i>, and at four we drove
to a large dinner at the Schloss. The Grand Duke led me, and I
always sit near him.</p>

<p>Yesterday at three the whole family drove to Seeheim, a lovely
place in the mountains, to dinner with the Grand Duke. In the two
villages we passed, flowers were showered upon us, and the Pfarrer
[clergyman] made a speech.</p>

<p>I am really deeply touched by the kindness and enthusiasm shown by
the people, which is said to be quite unusual. They wait near the
house to see us, and cheer constantly&mdash;even the soldiers.</p>

<p>We then drove for tea, which is always at eight, to Jugenheim to
Prince Alexander, whose birthday it was, and did not get home till
10.</p>

<p>The whole family are very amiable toward me, and Prince Alexander
is most clever and amusing.</p>

<p>Darling Louis is very grateful for your kind messages. We talk and
think of you often, and then my heart grows very heavy. Away from
home I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span>not believe that beloved Papa is not there; all is so
associated with him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
July 19th.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Mama</span>:&mdash;Many thanks for your last kind letter, and all the
news from home; dear Baby [Princess Beatrice] is the only one you
have mentioned nothing of, and I think of her so often.</p>

<p>Some people are coming to us at one, and then the whole Ministerium
[Administration]. It is really so difficult to find something to
say to these people, and they stand there waiting to be spoken to.</p>

<p>Yesterday we received a deputation from Giessen, with a very pretty
dressing-case they brought us as a present.</p>

<p>On Thursday we went incognito with Prince Alexander and his wife to
Frankfort. The town is decked out most beautifully, and countless
Schützen [riflemen] are walking about in their dress. We dined at
the Palais and then sat in the balcony.</p>

<p>I have just taken leave of dear Lady Churchill and General
Seymour.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They have made themselves most popular here, and the
people have been very civil to them.</p>

<p>Louis and I have begun reading “Westward Ho,” together.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke went all the way to Kranichstein for me the other
day, and walked about till he was quite hot. He has forbidden my
visiting the other places until his return, as he wishes to lead me
about there himself. I do not see very much of the other relations
save at meals; and, having our own carriages, we two drive together
mostly alone. We have tea usually out of doors in some pretty spot
we drive to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span></p>

<p>These lines will find you in Windsor. I went out this morning and
tried to find some of those pretty wreaths to send you, but could
get none. Please put one in St. George’s<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> from me. It is the
first time you go to that hallowed spot without me; but in thought
and prayer I am with you. May God strengthen and soothe you,
beloved Mama, and may you still live to find some ray of sunshine
on your solitary path, caused by the love and virtue of his
children, trying, however faintly, to follow his glorious example!</p>

<p>I do strive earnestly and cheerfully to do my duty in my new life,
and to do all that is right, which is but doing what dear Papa
would have wished.</p></div>

</p>

<p>Thousand thanks for your dear long letter of the 18th just
received. How well do I understand your feelings! I was so sad
myself yesterday, and had such intense longing after a look, a word
from beloved Papa! I could bear it no longer. Yet <i>how</i> much worse
is it not for you! You know, though, dear Mama, <i>he</i> is watching
over you, waiting for you. The thought of the future is the one
sustaining, encouraging point for all. “They who sow in tears shall
reap in joy”; and the great joy will be yours hereafter, dear Mama,
if you continue following that bright example. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>We usually get up about quarter or half-past seven, and take some
coffee at eight. Then we either go out till ten or remain at home,
and till twelve I write and arrange what I have to do.</p>

<p>At one, when we return from breakfast, we usually read together. I
have still a great many people to see, and they usually come at
two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span></p>

<p>At four is dinner, and at half-past five we are usually back here,
and occupy ourselves till six or seven, then drive out somewhere
for tea at eight, walk about and return at a quarter or half-past
ten. We do not waste our time, I assure you, and Louis has a good
deal to do at this moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Theed’s bust of dear Papa must be very lovely. I am curious to
hear what you think of Marochetti’s.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It will be very sad for
you to see.</p>

<p>A fortnight already I am here, and away from my dear home three
weeks! How much I shall have to tell you when we meet. My own dear
Mama, I do love you so much! You know, though silent, my love and
devotion to you is deep and true. If I could relinquish part of my
present happiness to restore to you some of yours, with a full
heart would I do it; but God’s will be done! God sustain my
precious mother! is the hourly prayer of her loving and
sympathizing child.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
July 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;You tell me to speak to you of <i>my</i> happiness&mdash;our happiness.
You will understand the feeling which made me silent towards you,
my own clear bereaved Mother, on that point; but you are unselfish
and loving and can enter into my happiness, though I could never
have been the first to tell you how intense it is, when it must
draw the painful contrast between your past and present existence.
If I say I love my dear husband, that is scarcely enough&mdash;it is a
love and esteem which increases daily, hourly; which he also shows
to me by such consideration, such tender loving ways. What was life
before to what it has become now? There is such blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span> peace
being at his side, being his wife; there is such a feeling of
security; and we two have a world of our own when we are together,
which <i>nothing</i> can touch or intrude upon. My lot is indeed a
blessed one; and yet what have I done to deserve that warm, ardent
love, which my darling Louis ever shows me? I admire his good and
noble heart more than I can say. How he loves me, you know, and he
will be a good son to you. He reads to me every day out of
“Westward Ho,” which I think very beautiful and interesting.</p>

<p>This morning I breakfasted alone, as he went out with his regiment.
I always feel quite impatient until I hear his step coming
up-stairs, and see his dear face when he returns.</p>

<p>Yesterday, and the previous night, I thought of you constantly, and
of our last journey together to dear Balmoral. Sad, painful though
it was, I liked so much being with you, trying to bear some of your
load of sorrow with you. From here I share all as if I were really
by your side; and I think so many fervent prayers cannot be offered
to a merciful loving God without His sending alleviation and
comfort.</p>

<p>Please remember me to Grant, Brown, and all of them at home in dear
Scotland, and tell them how much I wish, and Louis also, that we
were there, changed though every thing is.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
July 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;People say we may still have the Palais, but I doubt it. I am
going to tell the Grand Duke that we return to England in autumn
(not only for your sake, but principally because I do not wish to
incommode our parents any longer, and because in the winter we
could not even receive people here).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span></p>

<p>The only thing I shall regret in our not remaining here is, that
the people feel it so much, and they are most kind; but they will
see and understand that it cannot be otherwise, and that it does
not arise from ill will on our part.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Cecile and Michael<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> were here yesterday, so kind and so
full of real sympathy toward you, which they begged me to express
to you. He has such warm feelings; and they admired and loved dear
Papa, though they saw him but little.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, August 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;My heart feels ready to burst when I think of such sorrow as
yours. I pray my adored Louis may long be spared to me. If you only
knew how dear, how loving he is to me, and how he watches over me,
dear darling!</p>

<p>To-morrow we go to Coburg, which was an old promise. Dear Uncle
sent only two days ago to say he left Coburg on the 5th, and would
we not come before? You will understand that, happy beyond measure
as I am to go there, a lump always comes into my throat when I
think of it&mdash;going for the first time with Louis to dear Papa’s
house, where but recently he showed us every thing himself.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Dear Mama, I think I can scarcely bear it&mdash;the thought seems so
hard and cruel. He told us as children so much of Coburg, spoke to
us of it with such childlike affection, enjoyed so much telling us
every anecdote connected with each spot; and now these silent spots
seem to plead for his absence.</p>

<p>To see the old Baron [Stockmar] will be a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span> happiness, and
that Louis should make his acquaintance.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Calenberg bei Coburg</span>, August 4th.<br />
</p>

<p>Once more in dear Coburg, and you can fancy with what feelings.
Every thing reminds me of beloved Papa and of our last happy visit.</p>

<p>We are living here, and yesterday we spent all the afternoon and
dined at the Rosenau. It was a lovely day, and the view so
beautiful. We went all over the house and walked about in the
grounds. We walked to dear Papa’s little garden, and I picked two
flowers there for you, which I enclose.</p>

<p>Every spot brought up the remembrance of something dear Papa had
told us of his childhood; it made me so sad, I can’t tell you.
Uncle Ernest was also sad, but so kind and affectionate, and they
both seemed so pleased at our having come.</p>

<p>Every thing about dear Papa’s illness, and then of the sad end, I
had to tell. I lived the whole dreadful time over again, and
wonder, whilst I speak of it, that we ever lived through it.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock church service was in the pretty little chapel.
Holzei read, and Superintendent Meyer preached a most beautiful
sermon, the text being where our Saviour told his disciples they
must become as a little child to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
He spoke with his usual fervor, and it was most impressive. I saw
him afterward, and he enquired very much after you.</p>

<p>We are going after breakfast to the Festung, and then Louis and I
are going to see the dear Baron [Stockmar].</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, August 6th.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Beloved Mama</span>:&mdash;Can you give me no ray of hope that you in some
way, bodily or mentally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span> feel better? It makes my heart ache
bitterly, to hear those sad accounts you give of yourself, though I
well know what for you life without <i>him</i> must be! God comfort you!
is my constant prayer.</p>

<p>We saw the dear old Baron for some time. The meeting was sad on
both sides; he was very kind, but so desponding as to every thing!
In England and abroad he looks at every thing in a black light, and
was full of complaints about himself. He asked much after you, and
is anxious to see you again.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 9th.<br />
</p>

<p>Next Monday we are going to Auerbach, to live there for a little
time. It lies in the Bergstrasse, and is very healthy. The Grand
Duke allows us to inhabit one of the houses.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>How I long to read what Mr. Helps has written about Papa! What can
it be but beautiful and elevating, if he has rightly entered into
the spirit of that pure and noble being?<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Oh, Mama! the longing I sometimes have for dear Papa surpasses all
bounds. In thought he is ever present and near me; still we are but
mortals, and as such at times long for him also. Dear, good Papa!
Take courage, dear Mama, and feel strong in the thought that you
require all your moral and physical strength to continue the
journey which brings you daily nearer to <i>Home</i> and to <i>Him</i>! I
know how weary you feel, how you long to rest your head on his dear
shoulder, to have him to soothe your aching heart. You will find
this rest again, and how blessed will it not be! Bear patiently
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span> courageously your heavy burden, and it will lighten
imperceptibly as you near him, and God’s love and mercy will
support you. Oh, could my feeble words bring you the least comfort!
They come from a trusting, true, and loving heart, if from naught
else.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Auerbach</span>, August 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We do feel for you so deeply and would wish so much to help
you, but there is but One who can do that, and you know whom to
seek. He will give you strength to live on till the bright day of
reunion. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Auerbach</span>, August 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Our visit to Giessen<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> went off very well. The people were
most loyal. We went to see the Gymnasts, and Louis walked about
amongst them, which pleased them very much. He is very popular
there, and I am very glad we both went, for it made a good
impression.</p>

<p>We drove to Louis’ property, Stauffenberg, a beautiful (alas!
ruined) castle, which by degrees he is having restored, and which
will be a charming house for us, if it is finished, which can only
be done gradually.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Auerbach</span>, August 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Try and gather in the few bright things you have remaining
and cherish them, for though faint, yet they are types of that
infinite joy still to come. I am sure, dear Mama, the more you try
to appreciate and to find the good in that which God in His love
has <i>left</i> you, the more worthy you will daily become of that which
is in store. That earthly happiness you had is indeed gone forever,
but you must not think that every ray of it has left<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span> you. You have
the privilege, which dear Papa knew so well how to value, in your
exalted position, of doing good and living for others, of carrying
on his plans, his wishes into fulfilment, and as you go on doing
your duty, this will, this must, I feel sure, bring you peace and
comfort. Forgive me, darling Mama, if I speak so openly; but my
love for you is such that I cannot be silent, when I long so
fervently to give you some slight comfort and hope in your present
life.</p>

<p>I have known and watched your deep sorrow with a sympathizing,
though aching heart. Do not think that absence from you can still
that pain. My love for you is strong, is constant; I would like to
shelter you in my arms, to protect you from all future anxiety, to
still your aching longing! My own sweet Mama, you know I would give
my life for you, could I alter what you have to bear!</p>

<p><i>Trust in God!</i> ever and constantly. In <i>my</i> life I feel that to be
my stay and my strength, and the feeling increases as the days go
on. My thoughts of the future are bright, and this always helps to
make the minor worries and sorrows of the present dissolve before
the warm rays of that light which is our guide.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Auerbach</span>, August 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To-day is the Ludwigstag, a day kept throughout the country,
and on which every Ludwig receives presents, etc.; but we spend it
quite quietly. Louis’ parents and the others are coming to
breakfast, and remain during the day. Louis is out riding. We
always get up early. He rides whilst I write, and we then walk
together and breakfast somewhere out of doors.</p>

<p>We went to the little church here yesterday, which is very old, and
they sang so well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span></p>

<p>I drew out of doors also, as it was very fine; but it is very
difficult, as it is all green, and the trees are my misfortune, as
I draw them so badly. I play sometimes with Christa<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>; she plays
very well.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 26th [Prince Consort’s Birthday].<br />
</p>

<p>With a heavy heart do I take up my pen to write to you to-day&mdash;this
dear day, now so sad, save through its bright recollections. I
cannot bear to think of it now, with no one to bring our wishes to,
with that painful silence where such mirth and gaiety used to be.
It is very hard to bear, and the first anniversary is like the
commencement of a new epoch in our deep sorrow.</p>

<p>When your dear present was brought to me this morning, I could not
take my eyes from it, though they were blinded with tears. Oh,
those beautiful, those loved features! There wants but his kind
look and word to make the picture alive! Thousand thanks for it,
dear Mama.</p>

<p>How trying this day will be for you! My thoughts are constantly
with you, and I envy the privilege the others have in being near
you and being able to do the least thing for you.</p>

<p>The sun shines brightly in the still blue sky; how bright and
peaceful it must be where our dear Spirit dwells, if it is already
so beautiful here.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
September 5th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Two days ago Louis and I went to Worms. Whilst he went to his
regiment, which the Grand Duke came to inspect, I went to the Dom,
which is most beautiful; and then went in a little boat on the
Rhine, which was charming. It took us, driving, an hour and a half
from Auerbach to Worms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Auerbach</span>, September 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;For Louis’ birthday we are going to Darmstadt; it is getting
cold and damp here, and the house is small. We take our meals in
another house, and it is cold to walk over there of an evening.
Think of us on the 12th. It was such a happy day last year.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>I have such <i>Heimweh</i> [yearning] after beloved Papa; it is dreadful
sometimes when I think of him and of our home. But he is so happy
in his bright home, could we but catch a glimpse of him there. Dear
Grandmama [the Duchess of Kent], too, is constantly in my thoughts
lately. I can see her before me&mdash;so dear, kind, and merry. As time
goes on, such things only mingle themselves more vividly with one’s
usual life; for it is their <i>life</i> which is nearest us again, and
not their <i>death</i>, which casts such a gloom over their remembrance.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Auerbach</span>, September 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How beautiful Heidelberg is! we went all over the Castle, and
with such glorious weather. There is one side still standing, built
and decorated by a pupil of Michael Angelo, which dear Papa admired
so much. How do I miss not being able to talk to beloved Papa of
all I see, hear, feel, and think! His absence makes such a gap in
my existence.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Our visit to Baden was charming, and dear Fritz and
Louise<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> so kind! Louis and I were both delighted by our visit.
The Queen, the Duchess of Hamilton, and Grand Duchess Hélène<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span> were
there, besides dear Aunt [Princess Hohenlohe], and Countess
Blücher. The two latter, dear and precious as ever.</p>

<p>We left yesterday morning; spent three hours with Grand Duchess
Sophie, who is the most agreeable, clever, amiable person one can
imagine. It gave me real pleasure to make her acquaintance. Aunt
Feodore’s house, though small, is really very pretty, and her rooms
are hung full of pictures. I saw Winterhalter also, in his lovely
new house, which he has gone and sold, saying it was too good for
him. He has painted a most beautiful picture of the Grand Duchess
Hélène&mdash;quite speaking.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am going to make my will before leaving. I do not like
leaving (for England) without having done something.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>First of all, thousand thanks from Louis and me for your having
allowed dear Arthur<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> to come with us. I cannot tell you what
pleasure it has been to me to have that dear child a little bit. He
has won all hearts, and I am so proud when they admire my little
brother, who is a mixture of you and adored Papa.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We intend probably leaving this on Saturday, the 8th,
remaining until the 10th at Coblenz, from whence we go direct in
eleven hours and three-quarters to Antwerp, leaving Antwerp the
morning of the 12th, to reach Windsor that evening or the next
morning.</p>

<p>We always continue reading together, and have read <i>Hypatia</i>, a
most beautiful, most interesting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span> and very learned and clever
book, which requires great attention.</p>

<p>I have the great bore to read the newspapers every day, which I
must do; see Dr. Becker<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> from eleven to twelve; then I write,
and have constantly people to see, so that I have scarcely any time
to draw or to play. I also read serious book to myself.</p>

<p>Louis would like to go to Leeds and Manchester from Osborne, as he
wants to go to London from Windsor. I shall accompany him
sometimes.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
October 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>As you come later to Windsor, we shall not leave till the 10th,
remain the 11th with the Queen, then go direct to Antwerp. If the
weather is bad we shall wait. Then on the 14th or 15th we shall be
at Windsor, which we prefer to coming to Osborne. We hope this will
suit you.</p>

<p><i>All</i> are full of lamentations at our departure, and for so long,
which is most natural; but they are very kind. We have a family
dinner in our little room to-day, which is large enough for a few
people. The Grand Duke has quite lost his heart to Arthur, and
Bertie [Prince of Wales] pleased him also very much.</p>

<p>In talking together last night, Louis said what I feel so often,
that he always felt as if it must come right again some time, and
we should find dear Papa home again. In another <i>home</i> we shall.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
October 30th.<br />
</p>

<p>The Grand Duke was quite overcome when I gave him the photographs,
and with Baby’s [Princess Beatrice’s] he is quite enchanted, and
wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span> me to tell you how grateful he is, and how much he thanks
you. You cannot think <i>how</i> pleased he was, and the more so that
<i>you</i> sent them him. He has a warm heart and feels very much for
you, and takes a warm interest in all my brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>I am glad you are going to see dear Fritz of Baden; he will be so
pleased. We shall see Louise at Coblenz.</p>

<p>The plans for our house have come, and even the simplest is far
above what we poor mortals can build.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday, Mrs. Combe, widow of George Combe and daughter of

<h3><a name="yr-1863" id="yr-1863">1863</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Each</span> visit to her old home seemed to give fresh life to Princess Alice,
and it can therefore be easily understood how great her happiness was at
being again under her mother’s roof and care, there to await the
realization of her fondest hopes.</p>

<p>It was also a great comfort to the Princess to spend the first
anniversary of her father’s death with her family around her.</p>

<p>On the 18th of December, 1862, the remains of the Prince Consort were
placed in a temporary sarcophagus, in the centre of the newly-erected
mausoleum at Frogmore in the presence of the Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span> Wales, Prince
Arthur, Prince Leopold, and Prince Louis of Hesse.</p>

<p>Prince Louis occupied much of his time during his long stay in England
in making a number of interesting visits to the chief industrial
centres, and to military arsenals and depots.</p>

<p>Princess Alice met with a carriage accident on the last day of the old
year, which happily was followed by no bad consequences.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March, 1863, the Prince of Wales was married to the
Princess Alexandra of Denmark, at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle,
in the presence of the whole Royal family. It was the first Royal
marriage which had been celebrated in that chapel since the marriage of
Henry I., in 1122.</p>

<p>Soon after, on Easter Sunday, the 5th of April, 1863, Princess Louis of
Hesse gave birth to a daughter at Windsor Castle. This event was made
known next day at Darmstadt by the firing of twenty-one guns. The best
possible news continued to be received of the well-doing of mother and
child.</p>

<p>The little Princess was christened on the 27th of April, at Windsor, by
the Hessian Court chaplain, Bender. She received the names of Victoria
Alberta Elizabeth Matilda. The Princes Alexander and Henry of Hesse
represented the Grand Ducal family at the christening.</p>

<p>Princess Alice completed her recovery during a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span> stay at Osborne in May,
and while there was able to accompany the Queen on a visit to the
Military Hospital at Netley.</p>

<p>After a short stay in London, Prince and Princess Louis of Hesse and
their little daughter returned to Darmstadt. They spent the summer
months at Kranichstein, a shooting-lodge near Darmstadt, belonging to
the Grand Duke. The Princess employed her time in becoming better
acquainted with her adopted country, its inhabitants, their customs, and
ways of thinking.</p>

<p>The Congress of German Potentates and Princes at Frankfort, in August,
brought the Princess in contact with many crowned heads. She proved
herself her father’s true child in regard to politics. The Prince
Consort had always longed for an united Germany, with Prussia at its
head, and a Liberal constitution. Princess Alice’s letters will show how
truly German her feelings were in the Schleswig-Holstein question, which
at that time, owing to the death of King Frederick VII. of Denmark, and
the claims made by his successor, King Christian IX., to the succession
in the Duchies also, assumed a European interest, and led to
consequences of permanent importance in the history of Europe. The
accounts of the manner in which the Prince and Princess Louis endeavored
to fulfil their social duties throw a significant light upon the way in
which the young Princess discharged her duties as the mistress of her
home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span></p>

<p>In August the Princess met Queen Victoria at Coburg; and afterward had
the happiness of receiving Her Majesty and her sisters Hélèna, Louise
and Beatrice, and her brother Alfred, on a short visit at Kranichstein.</p>

<p>A few weeks later the Prince and Princess with their child joined the
Queen at Balmoral, where nearly all the members of the Royal family were
assembled.</p>

<p>In November they returned to Darmstadt, where, during their absence, the
new palace had made rapid progress, and was roofed in. It was built on a
site given by the Grand Duke, and after plans designed by the Princess
herself. The arrangement of the interior was entirely carried out by
herself in a manner both practical and artistic.</p>

<p>In December, Prince Louis’ only sister, Anna, was engaged to be married
to the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, an event which gave great
satisfaction at the time. The Princess spent her first Christmas in
Germany this year&mdash;1863.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Mama</span>:&mdash;Our parting this morning was most painful to both of
us&mdash;from you to whom we <i>owe</i> so much, and whom we love so dearly.</p>

<p>May God comfort and support you, beloved Mama, on your sad and
weary pilgrimage!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>I could not get your dear face and your sweet voice out of my mind
for an instant, and everywhere I thought I must see you or dear
Papa. It seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span> so strange; I had the tears in my eyes all day.
The worst was the opera, for I had never been without you or Papa,
and all was the same and yet so different. It was very trying to
me; and so will the drawing-room be to-day. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I saw Lady
Jocelyn, Duchess of Manchester, Sir Charles Locock, and Lord Alfred
Paget, to show them baby, and all find her like what we all were.
How much <i>we</i> have to thank for in her name. Your affection for her
and all you have done for her have touched us more than I can say.
It seemed to me quite wrong to take her from you.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Alix [Princess of Wales] and myself go to the
studios. This morning we drove in Battersea Park.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The drawing-room was long, but Alix and I were not so tired,
considering the length of time, for we stood, excepting twenty
minutes, in the middle, when there was a block and the people could
not come.</p>

<p>In to-day’s letter you mention again your wish that we should soon
be with you again. Out of the ten months of our married life five
have been spent under your roof, so you see how ready we are to be
with you. Before next year Louis does not think we shall be able to
come; at any rate when we can we shall, and I hope we shall be able
to see you for a day or two in Germany to divide the time.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Baby<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> has been so much admired, and all the clothes you

<p>I sha’n’t have time to write more than a few words, as we have just
returned from church and are going to Mayence till Wednesday. The
Grand Duke came all the way to Kranichstein yesterday to go about
with us, and see how to arrange it comfortably. He is most kind,
and sat an hour with me.</p>

<p>We have received two deputations this morning, and my things, which
ought to have been here before us, only arrived to-day.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Mayence</span>, June 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>There was a large dinner yesterday; the Nassaus dined here, and
this morning we have been to Biebrich. The Duke and Duchess,
Nicolas Nassau, Marianne of Prussia,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> her sister the Duchess of
Altenburg, and Landgrave William were there. They were most kind
and civil. We hurried back in time for dinner. The Grand Duke is
most kind, has taken me everywhere about himself&mdash;into the Dom,
into several shops, etc.</p>

<p>Now when I return I shall have to unpack and pack again for
Kranichstein, and arrange the house there, which has not been lived
in for eighty years, so that for writing I have barely a moment.</p>

<p>I have good accounts of baby, whom all the old gentlemen run out of
their houses to look at, when she walks in the garden, and try to
tell Moffat [her nurse] what they think of her, but she of course
understands nothing.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, June 3d.<br />
</p>

<p>I write to you to-day, as Louis is going for all day to Worms
to-morrow, and I am going to Jugenheim to Uncle Alexander. It is
already warm here, and we are going in a day or two into the
country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen of Prussia passes through here to-day, and I shall
probably hear from her what her intentions are about England. I
have received a splendid bracelet from the Empress of Russia&mdash;for
baby’s picture. She is said to be far from well.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, June 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Louis was away from four o’clock yesterday morning till
eleven at night. He was at Worms with Uncle Louis. Tuesday is his
birthday, and we shall very likely go on Monday to Mayence, as
Uncle Louis is always wishing for us.</p>

<p>I took a walk at Jugenheim yesterday with Uncle Alexander, his wife
and children, of more than two hours, and it was so beautiful, and
numberless little birds singing. Uncle Alexander was so grateful
for all your kindness, and was above all so charmed with you. It
always makes me so happy to be able to talk about you, and to hear
you appreciated as you ought to be, darling Mama.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Baby sits up quite strong, and looks about and laughs. She
has got on wonderfully, and she is so good. She was an hour with us
yesterday evening wide awake, and so good. She is as well and as
strong as any child could be. To-day we go to Mainz, and to-morrow
night from thence to Kranichstein. All our beds must be moved
meanwhile, as there are none in the house.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, June 12th.<br />
</p>

<p>Louis went at six this morning to Darmstadt for the inspection of
his regiment by Uncle Louis, Princess Charles’ birthday is on the
18th. The Grand Duke will be at Friedberg, and we are to go for the
day, which will be rather tiring, as it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span> good way by rail and
back again, and we have to wait an hour at Frankfort.</p>

<p>Louis is going to take his seat in the Chamber on the 23d. He was
unable to do so last year, as we left for England two days before
the time.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;You ask me again if I occupy myself much and seriously? Not a
moment of the day is wasted, and I have enough to read and to think
about: what with the many and different papers, and interesting
books. Dr. Becker comes daily, and I have a good deal to look
after.</p>

<p>We have a dinner to-day&mdash;Prince and Princess Charles, Uncle
Adalbert, Anna, William, and the suites.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;You will be amused to hear that I have taken a little black
(a Malay) into my service. He is a dear good boy, was brought over
two years ago by a gentleman, to whom he was given away by his own
parents as a mark of gratitude for some service done. This man has
had him here two years, but has never had him taught any thing. He
has no religion, and can neither read nor write. I am going to have
him taught, and, later, christened. He is very intelligent,
thirteen years old.</p>

<p>We shall remain here for the present; we go about a good deal
seeing things near by, and then it is the first time we have our
household and stable, so that on account of Haushaltung
[housekeeping], etc., we are going to remain here for a little
time. It is very pleasant besides, and constant moving is far too
expensive for us. We give dinners here, which are also useful, as I
know so few people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> Some of the Ständesherren are coming
to-morrow, and later some of the Abgeordneten [Deputies] of the
Second Chamber, which will give us an opportunity of making the
acquaintance of some of the Liberals in the country.</p>

<p>I cannot get rid of my rheumatism, which is so unpleasant.</p>

<p>Louis is very busy; he reads to me sometimes out of Lord Macaulay’s
last volume of the English History, which I had not yet read. Twice
a week Louis takes drill with his cavalry regiment, and he has to
ride out at six in the morning, as it is some way off.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 27th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I bathe every morning and swim about; there is a nice little
bathing-house.</p>

<p>I hear baby shrieking out of doors; she does not cry very much, but
she is very passionate. She was vaccinated two days ago by Dr.
Weber, and I am going to be done next week; the small-pox is at
Darmstadt, and a man died of it yesterday. Louis is very
industrious and busy; he has all the papers of the Stände [State
papers] to read and look through, and reads other useful books,
besides papers and other things which he must read. He wrote to
Lord Derby to express his thanks for having been made a Doctor at
Oxford. He takes a great deal of exercise, riding, walking, rowing,
swimming. We get up at six every morning, and go to bed after ten.</p>

<p>Louis has always a good deal to do at home, and a good many things
which would never be expected of him in England. He knows the
necessity and importance of working. I hope next month Uncle
Ernest<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> will come to us for a day on his way back<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span> from Homburg.
He has asked us for a few days to the Calenberg whilst you are in
Germany, and then in the winter we hope to be for a few days at
Gotha.</p>

<p>The Lützows,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and Miss Seymour dine with us to-day.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 30th.<br />
</p>

<p>Lady Fife is at Homburg, and is coming to dine with us. To-morrow
all the family and some other people come to dinner. We have seen a
good many people; we receive in the morning or for dinner.</p>

<p>Dalwigk gave a large <i>soirée</i> in the woods, with a supper for us,
last night. All the Ständesherren and Foreign Ministers were there.</p>

<p>To-morrow is our dear wedding-day. With what gratitude do I look
back to that commencement of such happiness, and such real and true
love, which even daily increases in my beloved husband. Oh, may we
not be deprived of it too soon! I admire and respect him for his
true-hearted, generous, unselfish, and just nature! Oh, dear Mama,
if you only knew how excellent he is! I wish I were good like him,
for he is free from any selfish, small, or uncharitable feelings.
You should see how he is beloved by all his people; our servants
adore him. I open my heart to you, who have so warm and
sympathizing a heart, that even in the midst of such deep grief and
sorrow as yours will listen to what your children, who love you
dearly, long to say.</p>

<p>Our little one is grown so pretty; she has little pink cheeks, and
is so fat and so good-humored. I often think her like you when she
smiles.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
July 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>You can fancy how much we thought of this day<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span> last year, and of
you and all the love and kindness you showed us then. How truly we
both love you, and, when we can, how willingly we shall come to
your side, and be of the least use to you, you know, for I feel for
you and with you, more than words can describe.</p>

<p>Our first large dinner yesterday went off very well. We make our
arrangements, sitting, etc., all as you and dear Papa had it, which
is new here, but I am happy to say, approved of. We always dine at
four. Baby appeared afterward, and really never cries when she is
shown, but smiles, and seems quite amused. She is immensely
admired, particularly for her healthy appearance and fine large
eyes. I really think her like you now; she is very much changed,
and, when she sits up, looks so pretty and dear.</p>

<p>To-day we have again a dinner. There is a fine dining-room and
drawing-room here, so that we can see a good many people.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
July 4th.<br />
</p>

<p>Shortly we are going to pay Prince Solms-Lich, the president of the
First Chamber, a visit. He is very liberal on the whole, rich, and
a nice old gentleman. He knew Grandpapa in the year 1820, also
Uncle Charles, Uncle Hohenlohe, Aunt Feodore, and Eliza. Lady Fife,
Annie, and Mr. Corbett from Frankfort are coming to us to-day.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke of Weimar was here yesterday for dinner at the
Schloss.</p>

<p>What you said about Germany is so true; and Louis has the real good
of his country near at heart. They always have to vote for or
against what the Second Chamber brings forward, and the other day a
vote was sent in from the Liberals for an altera<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span>tion of a press
law. Only one voice in the whole Chamber was for it, which was
Louis’, and this produced a very good effect among the Liberals. He
is no coward, and will say what he thinks, if it is necessary, even
if all are against him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, July 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>To-day is Uncle Alexander’s birthday, and we have to drive for
dinner to Seeheim. To-morrow morning we leave for Lich at five in
the morning.</p>

<p>Two nights ago a horrid and <i>schauerliches</i> [appalling] event took
place here. I went out about eight down to the pond, which is close
to the house, to meet Louis. I met an odd-looking pale man, who
neither bowed nor looked about, walking slowly along; and when I
joined Louis he asked me if I had seen him, as he had been prowling
about all the afternoon. We stopped a little longer, when at the
end our grooms were running. We rowed on to see what was the
matter, and on coming near, a body was floating in the water, the
face already quite blue and lifeless. I recognized him at once.
Louis and the others with trouble fished him out and laid him in
our boat to bring him on shore. It was very horrid to see. We
brought him on shore, tried all means to restore him to life, but
of no avail. He was carried into the stable. He had committed
suicide, and we heard afterward that he was a very bad character.
You can fancy that it was very unpleasant to me, to have that
disfigured corpse next me in the boat; and it haunts me now,&mdash;for a
violent death leaves frightful traces, so unlike any thing else.
But half or quarter of an hour before, I had passed that man in
life, and so shortly after to see him floating by quite lifeless!
It brings death before one in its worst form, when one sees a <i>bad
man</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> die by his own hand. The indifference with which the other
people treated it, and dragged him along, was also revolting to
one’s feelings; but one must be manly, and not mind those things;
yet I own it made me rather sick, and prevented my sleep that
night.</p>

<p>I am glad we are going away for a few days; the change will be
pleasant.</p>

<p>It was such a pleasure to me to have seen dear Lady Frances Baillie
the other day, and she was looking well, though she is very thin.</p>

<p>You kindly gave me our dear Papa’s Farm-book for the Farmers’ Union
here; the people are so touched and pleased. I send you the letter
of thanks to read.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Lich</span>, July 18th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We leave to-morrow afternoon for Frankfort, and the next day
we go to Homburg on the way home. The Prince and Princess are most
kind and civil; they have a fine Schloss, and are rich. The latter
is clever and amiable, and the young people&mdash;their nephews and
nieces&mdash;are very nice and very kind. It is a fine, rich country,
and they seem very much beloved. The sister of the Princess,
Princess Solms-Laubach, <i>née</i> Büdingen, is here also. Her husband
was in the Prussian service, and they lived at Bonn whilst dear
Papa was there. He came to see them and to spend the evening there
very often. She told me how handsome he then was, and how much
praised and liked by all. She asked after Rath Florschütz,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and
Eos,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and if dear Papa continued later on to be so sleepy of an
evening, as he was even then.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, July 21st.<br />

<p>Our visit at Lich went off very well. Everything is so <i>vornehm</i>
[in such good style] and so well arranged.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
July 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>We are going to give Heinrich<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> a rendezvous somewhere, perhaps
at Kreuznach, which is not very far. On August 1st, we are going to
the north of the country,&mdash;a part which I do not know,&mdash;and on the
way we stop at Giessen, where we have been invited to see an
agricultural exhibition. On Monday we give a tea and a
dance&mdash;between fifty and sixty people. The advantage of this place
is its nearness to Darmstadt, and that there is room enough to
receive people.</p>

<p>The Russian and French ambassadors, with their wives, and Mr.
Corbett and Lord Robert S. Kerr, dine with us to-day.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
July 27th.<br />
</p>

<p>I have no news to give. To-night we give our first large
party&mdash;seventy people.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday we were all day at Rumpenheim: so kindly received! The
Landgrave, his two brothers, Frederic and George, the Dowager
Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, her daughter Duchess Caroline,
Aunt Cambridge, Mary, Augusta, and Adolphus; Fritz and Anna of
Hesse and good Princess Louise, kindness itself. Aunt Cambridge was
very amiable, and spoke most tenderly of you. To-morrow morning
Louis goes to Oberhessen, where I join him in two days. I go to see
Uncle Alexander at Jugenheim; go on Monday to Friedberg, where
there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span> an asylum for blind people, of which I am Protectorin
[Patroness]. I go to see it, and sleep at the Castle. The next day
I stop on my road to see Marburg, and shall be in the evening at
Alsfeld, where I find Louis. The next day I go on to Herr von
Riedesel at Altenburg, where I breakfast, and I dine and spend the
night with another Riedesel family at Eisenbach. Louis joins me
that evening. The next day we go on though the country, as the
people are anxious to see us, and the country is very beautiful. On
Thursday and Friday we shall be at Giessen, on Saturday at home.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Giessen</span>, August 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>I am very hot and tired; we have only just reached this place, and
have to go out almost immediately to see the animals and machines.</p>

<p>Our journey has been most prosperous, but rather tiring, and the
heat quite fearful. We were most kindly received everywhere.
English, Hessian, German flags everywhere, and <i>Gesangvereine</i> of
an evening.</p>

<p>Last night we slept at Schotten, and posted from thence to-day
through a lovely, rich, wooded, and mountainous district, the
Vogelsberg.</p>

<p>We have had but one room everywhere, and have remained only long
enough at a place to see it, so that writing has been impossible.
To-morrow evening we return to Kranichstein, and then I will write
to you an account of every thing. Here, with no time, and with such
heat and noise, it is impossible.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, August 9th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We went, when I last wrote to you at Giessen, to see the
different machines at work, in a crowd close round us and a
smothering heat. It was interesting, though, in spite of all. The
people<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span> cheered and were very civil. That day, at the meeting of
the agriculturists, Count Laubach told me dear Papa’s book lay on
the table, and is of the greatest use and interest. I am so pleased
to have been the first in Germany to make known something of Papa’s
knowledge in this science, one of the many in which dear Papa
excelled. The people are so grateful to you for having sent it. In
the evening the president and some other scientific gentlemen came
to tea with us. I was so glad to see how pleased the people were at
the interest Louis takes in these things. A procession was really
very pretty; large carts, decorated with the different agricultural
emblems, peasants in their different costumes&mdash;it was something
quite new to me.</p>

<p>At Marburg, I saw in the beautiful church the grave of St.
Elizabeth, the castle where she lived, and many other things which
Kingsley mentions in his “Saint’s Tragedy.”</p>

<p>This week the Emperor of Austria and other potentates came to
Frankfort. The King of Prussia has refused, so that now, as it is
not a universal meeting, it will not be what it might have been.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The Emperor came all the way to Kranichstein to pay us a
visit, and is very amiable, though not very talkative. Archduke
William, King Max, and the Duke of Brunswick were also here
yesterday.</p>

<p>We saw the procession to the Römer from a small room, already
filled by twelve Rumpenheimers! It was a very interesting sight.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;This evening all the crowned heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span> nearly are coming to the
opera, and the Rumpenheimers very likely also. Uncle Ernest comes
to us for dinner, and we take him with us.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We dined at Homburg yesterday afternoon with the old
hereditary Grand Duchess of Schwerin, Louis’ great-aunt, who is
eighty-six, and as fresh and lively as ever. The Duke of Altenburg
and the Grand Duke of Schwerin were with us, and both of them wish
to have their respectful duty sent to you.</p></div>

on a visit to the Queen.]</p>

</p>

<p>Thousand thanks for your dear lines! How sad that we should be
reduced to writing again! It was such a happiness to speak to you,
and in return to hear all you had to say,&mdash;to try and soothe you,
and try to make your burden lighter. I always feel separation from
you so much, for I feel for and with you, more, oh, far more, than
I can ever express! I can only say again, trust, hope, and be
courageous, and every day will bring something in the fulfilment of
all your great duties, which will bring you peace, and make you
feel that you are not forsaken, that God has heard your prayer,
felt for you, as a loving Father would, and that dear Papa is not
far from you.</p>

<p>We remain here to-night, as Louis had a bad sick-headache,
toothache, and so on, and he must rest. We leave to-morrow
afternoon.</p>

<p>Affie [Prince Alfred] and William (of Hesse)<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span> were very well, and
seem quite happy together. Affie sends love, and William his
respects.</p></div>

</p>

<p>Before going out (half-past six) I begin these lines. You will have
heard what an awful passage we had. Christa and I had one of those
cabins near the paddle-box, and good old May<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> was with us. Each
wave that broke on the ship Christa and I groaned, and May
exclaimed: “Oh, goodness, gracious me! what an awful sea! Lord
bless you, child, I hope it is all safe!” and so on. If we had not
been so wretched, and had not looked so awful with those mountains
of waves about us, I should have laughed. All the maids and Moffat
were sick. Baby was sick all over her nice new shawl, which was a
great grief.</p>

<p>Uncle Louis and Uncle Gustav received us at the station. My
parents-in-law don’t return till Wednesday. Yesterday Uncle Louis
gave us a large dinner, and to-day he dines <i>en famille</i> in our
house with Prince Adalbert of Bavaria, Uncle Gustav,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and
ourselves.</p>

<p>I was quite done up by this journey. At four in the morning we
changed carriages at Cologne, and did not get here till past twelve
o’clock&mdash;twenty-nine hours under way.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday evening Louis and I were at a chemical lecture,
which was very interesting, by young Hallnachs, the brother of the
one Becker spoke to you about.</p>

<p>Our house is getting on very well, and we are often there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span></p>

<p>Louis is very grateful and touched by your kind message, and kisses
your hand. He is often away for those tiresome Jagden
[shooting-parties] from five in the morning till eight at night, as
it is some way off.</p></div>

<p>It is not yet eight, and I have such cold fingers. The messenger
leaves at nine, so I must write now. We are going to Mayence
to-day, to see a house of our architect Kraus, which is said to be
very pretty and very English.</p>

<p>I paid Becker and his mother a visit yesterday. Their rooms are so
nice, pictures and presents from you and dear Papa in all
directions, remembrances of past, such happy, years!</p>

<p>Yesterday also I drove baby out in my little carriage. She sat on
Christa’s knees and looked about her so much; she went to sleep at
last.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday I was all the morning with Julie Battenberg buying
Christmas presents. To-day also I am much occupied. We get up at
seven, with candles, every morning, as this is the best time for
doing all business, and breakfast at eight.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The Holstein question, I fear, will lead to war. Fritz’<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
rights are so clear. And I am sure all Germany will help him to
maintain his rights, for the cause is a just one.</p>

<p>I am sure, dear Mama, you are worried to death about it, which is
very hard, for you cannot undo what once exists. <i>Any thing</i> only
to <i>avoid</i> war! It would be a sad calamity for Germany, the end of
which no one can foresee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span></p>

<p>My baby has this morning cut her first tooth, and makes such faces
if one ventures to touch her little mouth.</p>

<p>To-day I am going to visit the hospital in the town, which is said
not to be good or well looked after. I want to be able to do
something for it, and hope to succeed, for the people have plenty
of money, only not the will. The Burgomaster and Gemeinderath [the
Town Councillors] will meet me there.</p>

<p>I have just called into life what did not exist&mdash;that is, linen to
be lent for the poor women in their confinements, and which I hope
will be of use to them, for the dirt and discomfort is very great
in those classes.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 28th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;My visit to the hospital was very interesting, and the air
was good, the place clean and fresh. There were few people
dangerously ill there, and they looked well taken care of. Air and
water are making their way into these places to the benefit of
mankind.</p>

<p>I was so much distressed the other day; for the poor man who fell
in our house has died. He was a soldier, and so respectable and
industrious, not above twenty-four. This is already the second who
has died in consequence of a fall.</p>

<p>Our visit to Carlsruhe was very pleasant. The Queen [of Prussia]
was there, and we spoke so much of you together. She enters quite
into all your feelings, and perfectly understands all the sad
trials and difficulties of your position in addition to your just
and natural grief.</p></div>

</p>

<p>A few words of love and affection from us both on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span> this dear
day&mdash;the third anniversary of the commencement of all our
happiness, which dear Papa and you enabled us to form.</p>

<p>Those happy days at Windsor and those awful days the year after! I
assure you the season, the days, <i>all</i> make me sad&mdash;for the
impression of those two years can never be wiped out of my mind. I
can write but a few lines, as to-morrow we leave for Amorbach, and
to-day I go with Louis out shooting. It is cold and fine, as it was
two years ago.</p>

<p>Darling Mama, again and again we thank you and beloved Papa for all
your love to us at that time.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Amorbach</span>, December 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We arrived here at half-past four yesterday, after a bitter
cold drive in an open carriage over hard roads, all being frozen,
since ten in the morning. The country we came through was
beautiful, though all white, up and down hill all the way, through
many villages, through woods, etc. The house is large and
comfortable, full of souvenirs of dear Grandmama [Duchess of Kent],
of Uncle Charles.</p>

<p>I am so pleased to be with Ernest and Marie,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> it is a bit of
home again.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Our visit to Amorbach was so pleasant, though the weather was
bad. I was so happy to be once more with Ernest and Marie.
Edward<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> was very amusing and good-natured. I saw poor old
Wagner,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> who wishes me to send you his duty.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Think, only yesterday evening at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span> concert they played “Ruy
Blas,” which I had not heard since Windsor. The room, the band,
dear Papa, all came before me, and made my heart sink at the
thought that <i>that</i> belonged to the bright recollections of the
past! I cried all the way home. Such trivial things sometimes
awaken recollections more vividly, and hurt more keenly, than
scenes of real distress. I am sure you know what I mean.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 12th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I must close; my tears fall fast, and I ought not to make you
sadder, when you are sad enough already. Pray for me when you kneel
at <i>his</i> grave&mdash;pray that my happiness may be allowed to last long;
think of me when you kneel there where on that day my hand rested
on your and Papa’s dear hands, two years ago. That bond between us
both is <i>so</i> strong, beloved Mama. I feel it as a legacy from him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 22d.<br />
</p>

<p>A great pleasure I have had in arranging a tree for our good
servants. I bought all the things myself at the market, and hung
them on the tree; then I also got things for darling Louis.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We all had trees in one large room in the Palace, and our
presents underneath it looked extremely pretty. Uncle Alexander’s
five children were there, and made such a noise with their
play-things.</p>

<p>Baby had a little tree early at her Grandpapa and Grandmama’s, with
all her pretty things.</p>

<p>Many thanks for the turkey-pie; we give a dinner to-day in honor.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="yr-1864" id="yr-1864">1864</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1864 was a most eventful one for Germany. After a severe
struggle, the Duchies of Schleswig-Holstein were wrested from the
control of the German Confederation or Diet at Frankfort, and occupied
by Austrian and Prussian troops. The Princess’ own life that year was
full of joyful events, and no cloud of sorrow came to disturb her
happiness.</p>

<p>The marriage of Princess Anna of Hesse, which took place on the 12th of
May, was a cause of great rejoicing to the family.</p>

<p>During the first months of the year the Prince and Princess paid several
short visits to Gotha, Carlsruhe, and Munich, and in the summer spent
three happy months in England.</p>

<p>On their return to Germany they received numerous guests at
Kranichstein. But in spite of the many social duties and distractions in
which the Princess took an active part, she never lost sight of more
serious duties and pursuits. She became the “Protectress” of the
“Heidenreich Institution for Lying-in Women,” which was the beginning of
the active interest afterward taken by her in all sanitary improvements.
This interest was heightened by the birth of her second daughter, who
was born on the 1st of November, 1864, and christened on the 28th of
that month, receiving the names of Elizabeth Alexandra Louise Alice. The
Princess was very proud of being able to nurse her child herself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span>
from this time she took up with the keenest interest all questions
relating to the physical, mental, and moral training of children. She
found an able supporter and independent adviser in Dr. Weber, a very
eminent medical man, resident at Darmstadt.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The cold here is awful. I skated yesterday, and to-day we are
going to the pond at Kranichstein. (Very few people skate
here&mdash;only one lady, and she very badly.) Baby only goes out for
half an hour in the middle of the day, well wrapped up. It would
not do to keep her quite at home, as she would become so sensitive
when first taken out again. Of course when it is windy or too cold
she stops in.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 9th.<br />
</p>

<p>I was aghast on receiving of Bertie’s telegram this morning
announcing the birth of their little son. Oh, may dear Papa’s
blessing rest on the little one; may it turn out like dear Papa,
and be a comfort and a pride to you, and to its young parents! Your
first English grandchild. Dear Mama, my heart is so full. May dear
Alix and the baby only go on well!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Baby says “Papa,” “Mama,” and yesterday several times
“Louis.” She imitates every thing she hears, all noises and sounds;
she gets on her feet alone by a chair, and is across the room
before one can turn round. Her adoration for Louis is touching. She
stops always, since the summer, alone in our room, so she never
cries for Moffat [her nurse], and is very happy on the floor with
her play-things. She is a very dear little thing and gets on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> very
fast, but equally in all things, and is as fat as she was. It is so
interesting to watch the progress and development of such a little
being; and baby is so expressive, she makes such a face when she is
not pleased, and laughs so heartily when she is contented. She is
more like a child of two years old a great deal.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Gotha</span>, January 22d.<br />
</p>

<p>After a very cold journey we arrived here on Wednesday afternoon. I
found dear uncle and aunt well, Leopoldine (who is very dear and
nice) and Hermann,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Edward and Marie Leiningen, and Prince
Lowenstein here. Only Hermann and Leopoldine live in the Castle
besides us; the others are all at uncle’s house.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;These poor Schleswig-Holsteiners do what they can to liberate
themselves from the Danish yoke, and to regain their lawful
sovereign, Fritz. And why is England, who stands up for freedom of
countries, who in Italy, where there was less cause, did what she
could to liberate the country from her lawful sovereigns, to do
what she can to prevent the Schleswig-Holsteiners from liberating
themselves from a king who has no right over them, merely because
they are unfortunate good-natured Germans, who allow themselves to
be oppressed?</p></div>

<span class="i0">Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Thank God, my husband has none! I thank the Almighty daily for our
peaceful homely life, in which sphere we can do a good deal of good
to our fellow-creatures, without having to mix in those hateful
politics.</p>

<p>Our life is a very, very happy one. I have nothing on earth to wish
for, and much as I loved my precious Louis when I married him,
still more do I love him now and daily; for his character is worthy
of love and respect, and a better husband or father, a more
unselfish and kind one, there does not live. His love for you, you
know; and on our return how glad we shall be to be near you once
more.</p></div>

<p>Louis is in the Chamber to-day from nine till one, long enough at a
stretch, and immediately after breakfast. We always breakfast at
eight; then Louis sees the three officers who come every morning on
his military business, then Westerweller and all others who have
business. We usually walk before luncheon, which is at twelve; and
often drive at two or three. At five we dine; at half-past six,
theatre, four times a week, till half-past nine; then we take tea
together, Louis reads to me, and I work. On other week-days there
are concerts or parties. We are often in our new house, and in the
garden, arranging things and watching the progress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span> We also go to
lectures here, and are much occupied, which makes the day pass so
quickly.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>I have learned much since I married, and, above all, not to be
dependent on others in my existence. To be able to make a bright
and comfortable home for my dear husband is my constant aim; but
even in this one often fails, for self constantly turns up, like a
bad sixpence. Oh, how dear Papa spoke about that! His whole noble
life was that one bright example of sacrificing himself to his
duty. Dear, adored Papa! such goodness, such love, when one thinks
of it, must silence all complaints of petty troubles in the mouths
of his children and servants. You, dear Mama, are the one who
suffers the most, though this awful loss has touched all; and to
soothe your grief and to help you lightens one’s own.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 5th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Spring always makes me so <i>wehmüthig</i> [sad], I don’t know
why; one longs for every thing and any thing which is out of one’s
reach.</p>

<p>I will tell you of something I did the other day; but please tell
no one, because not a soul but Louis and my ladies know of it here.
I am the patroness of the “Heidenreich Stiftung,” to which you also
gave a handsome present in the beginning. The ladies who belong to
it go to bring linen to poor respectable <i>Wöchnerinnen</i> [women in
child-bed], who claim their assistance. They bring them food, and,
in short, help them. All cases are reported to me. The other day I
went to one <i>incog.</i> with Christa, in the old part of the town&mdash;and
the trouble we had to find the house! At length, through a dirty
courtyard, up a dark ladder into one little room, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span> lay in one
bed the poor woman and her baby; in the room four other children,
the husband, two other beds, and a stove. But it did not smell bad,
nor was it dirty. I sent Christa down with the children, then with
the husband cooked something for the woman; arranged her bed a
little, took her baby for her, bathed its eyes&mdash;for they were so
bad, poor little thing!&mdash;and did odds and ends for her. I went
twice. The people did not know me, and were so nice, so good and
touchingly attached to each other; it did one’s heart good to see
such good feelings in poverty. The husband was out of work, the
children too young to go to school, and they had only four kreuzers
in the house when she was confined.</p>

<p>Think of that misery and discomfort!</p>

<p>If one never sees any poverty, and always lives in that cold circle
of Court people, one’s good feelings dry up, and I felt the want of
going about and doing the little good that is in my power. I am
sure you will understand this.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 14th.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My own Dear precious Mama</span>:&mdash;These words are for the 16th, the first
hard trial of our lives, where I was allowed to be with you. Do you
recollect when all was over [death of the Duchess of Kent], and
dear Papa led you to the sofa in the colonnade, and then took me
<i>to you</i>? I took that as a sacred request from him to love,
cherish, and comfort my darling mother to all the extent of my weak
powers. Other things have taken me from being constantly with you;
but nothing has lessened my intense love for you, and longing to
quiet every pain which touches you, and to fulfil, even in the
distance, his request.</p>

<p>Oh, darling Mama, were there words in which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span> could express to you
how much I am bound up with you, how constantly my thoughts and
prayers are yours, I would write them. The sympathies of our souls
can only tell each other how tender my love and gratitude to you
is, and how vividly I feel every new trial or new thing with you
and for you. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I was with another poor woman, even worse off, this morning, and on
the third day she was walking in the room and nearly fainted from
weakness. Those poor people!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday morning at nine we took the Sacrament&mdash;all the
family and congregation together. The others then stopped for the
rest of the service, till after eleven. I went home and returned
for the English service at twelve. At half-past six, in the
Stadtkirche, Bach’s “Passion” was given.</p></div>

Queen and we all with our Gefolge [suite] dined in the Winter
Garden. It seemed to try her very much, but she is so wonderfully
quiet that she scarcely shows it. I was three hours with her
yesterday evening. She spoke so kindly of you and with such
sympathy and interest, and said, when dear Papa died, she had
prayed for you so much.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Between sight-seeing, and going to the Queen’s room, and
being with her, I have not a moment scarcely to rest or write.
Yesterday we visited the whole Schloss full of frescoes, and the
studios of all the famous painters&mdash;so interesting. How dear Papa
would have enjoyed it! I was thinking the whole time what he would
have thought of certain pictures, and how much he would have
admired some. But at all times seeing things, and most of all
pictures, is fatiguing.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, April 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;On Monday Louis goes into the country to shoot capercailzies
[<i>Auerhahne</i>]. I accompany him part of the way, but stop at
Schweinsberg with Christa’s parents. The air is very good there,
and we thought the country would do me good.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We shall leave probably later [for England], after or just
before your birthday. We have a great deal to do in London for our
house, for which I should want a week; and from Windsor to leave
you for a whole week I should not like, and to go up constantly is
rather tiring.</p>

<p>We go from Mayence to Rotterdam by steamer, from thence by rail to
Antwerp, and then wait for good weather to cross, so that we shall
be long under way, but quite easily and comfortably.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

<p>Many thanks for your letter, and above all for your great kindness

<p>Christa and Becker wrote an account of the wedding,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> so I won’t
write any more about it save that it went off very well and was
very <i>vornehm</i> and well-arranged. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I have borne the fatigues well; but two days before, for two days
and one night, I was very unwell. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Dr. Weber is a clever man,
and is <i>vielseitig</i> [many-sided] in his views on medicine and
treatment of illnesses. I think you will like him.</p>

<p>Baby runs alone through two rooms without falling now; she learnt
it in a week. She will amuse you so much. Yesterday Louis drove me
and his two brothers in a break, and baby went with us much
enchanted.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To-morrow afternoon Fritz and Anna leave. To-day the town

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is excessively hot, which makes me so tired and weak. I am

<p>The parting from Anna three days ago was dreadful; she so
distressed, and her parents also. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span> They begin their old age
alone, so to say, for there are no children in their house any
more. It makes us both very sad to leave them, and seems so
unfeeling; but we shall return to them soon. What a blessing that
you have Beatrice and two brothers, still boys; and yet, for one
alone what an anxiety!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Marlborough House</span>, May 26th.<br />

<p>Arrived here at half-past eleven, and quite rested. I at once write
to you to thank you for your letter and for the great comfort of
the ships. I feel so much better already from the air on the Rhine
those two days, and the fresh sea air, that I have borne the
journey this way with but little fatigue. I find Bertie and Alix
both looking well, and the baby so pretty and dear.</p>

<p>I slept during the whole night passage, as I went to bed early. I
had about twelve hour’s sleep, which has completely set me up.
Louis is paying visits. We have lunched, and in the afternoon
Bertie and Alix have promised to call on Lady Augusta and Dean
Stanley, and we join them. Aunt Cambridge and Mary we shall see
afterward.</p></div>

yet satisfactory. We read all the accounts you kindly sent us with
much interest.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The Emperor [of Russia] with his second and third sons
arrived yesterday. We saw him at the station at Darmstadt, but did
not join them as the rest of the family did. We go to Jugenheim

Beatrice’s age, has such a passion for her. The children are very
nice, the two older sons very big. Uncle Gustav is here, which
makes me think of you here this time last year.</p></div>

September 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Two days ago we had intense heat, and since great cold&mdash;the
two extremes constantly, which is so unwholesome. The Emperor is
very grateful for your message, and sends his best remembrance. * *
* There were seven young men to dinner yesterday, and your glass
was used for the first time and looked so pretty.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
September 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The Emperor and Empress [of Russia] before leaving took a
most tender farewell of us, and she gave me their Order. They
return to Darmstadt on the 27th for a fortnight, as it is now
settled that the Empress is to spend the winter at Nice, and she
may not go there till the beginning of October at the soonest, as
it would be too warm.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We are in the middle of the second vol<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span>ume of Froude,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> but
it is too detailed to interest you; you have far too much to do to
be interested in it. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Robertson’s beautiful sermons we have
also read together, and I have discovered that a German translation
exists, and have ordered one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardinge<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> leaves me the end of this month, I am sorry to
say; for she is very nice, discreet, and ready to do any thing, and
not at all of the present bad English <i>genre</i>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
September 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;What you say about the poor sisters, and indeed of all the
younger ones, is true. The little brothers and Beatrice are those
who have lost the most, poor little things! I can’t bear to think
of it, for dear Papa, more peculiarly than any other father, was
wanted for his children; and he was the dear friend, and even
playfellow, besides. Such a loss as ours is indeed unique. Time
only increases its magnitude, and the knowledge of the want is felt
more keenly.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I was yesterday in our little house, arranging and clearing
out the rooms. We shall have very close quarters, but it will not
be uncomfortable.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I often wish dear Papa could have seen what a treasure I have
in my darling; but I am sure he does see it, and his blessing with
yours rests on us, for we seem not separated from either of you,
our life is so interwoven with yours.</p>

<p>Where people are unselfish, loving, good, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span>dustrious, like my
dear Louis, I always feel a certain likeness beginning to grow up
with our dear angel Father! Don’t you? Oh, may we all only become
like him! I struggle so hard, dear Mama, in the many little trials
I daily have, to become more like him. My trials melt away when I
think of you, and I wish I were great and strong to be able to bear
some of your great trials for you. Dear Mama, how I love you! how
we both love you, and would shield you with our love from all new
blows and trials, you know. God comfort you! My heart is often too
full to say all that is in it; to tell you all my love and
devotion, for your own precious sake, and for dear Papa’s, who left
you as a legacy to us all to love and to cherish for him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
September 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>To-morrow Louis, I, and my two ladies, take the sacrament in the
little church here. I wished much to take it before my hour of
trial comes. Dear Louis read to me yesterday evening Robertson’s
sermon on the “Sympathy of Christ.”</p>

<p>We have fine autumn weather, and I am out as much as I can. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I
sleep well and breakfast always at half-past eight; we dine at two,
and take supper at eight, then my ladies read aloud, and I work or
Christa plays, Louis reads his papers, etc. To myself I read Lord
Malmesbury’s “Memoirs,” which are very curious, and when Louis has
time he reads Froude to me.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, October 4th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To-morrow dear Uncle Leopold [King of the Belgians] comes for
a few hours. Louis will go to Darmstadt or Mayence to meet him, and
I will receive him at the station, as none of the family know<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span> him.
Louis is out shooting with the Emperor. Uncle Alexander’s throat
has already begun to be bad again.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am writing quite a confused letter in the midst of
household troubles, for the Emperor and Empress have just let me
know that they wish to breakfast here, and Louis is out, and I
don’t know where or how to have the things in our small <i>ménage</i>. I
must therefore conclude and do my business.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
October 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I had the pleasure of seeing dear Uncle two days ago looking
wonderfully well, and kind and dear as ever. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To-day I must go
to a large family dinner. Fritz and Anna of Hesse, Grand Duchess
Marie, and Prince and Princess William of Baden, besides ourselves,
the family, and the Emperor and Empress.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>We are at length here, in great disorder, and I have been waiting
half an hour only for a pen to be found. I am tired and not very
well. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Augusta [Lady Augusta Stanley] being with you I am very
glad of, and she must be such a comfort to you, for besides being
such a friend, she has that peculiar charm of manner which all the
Bruces possess.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
October 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am so grieved about poor Louise; she will want much care
and attention.</p>

<p>Lady Car. [Caroline Barrington] is here since yesterday evening to
my great delight, and is not looking the worse for her journey.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
October 29th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To-morrow we expect Vicky and Fritz <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span>[Crown Prince and
Princess of Prussia] for two hours, and later Bertie and Alix on
their way back from Amorbach, for a few hours. I shall be delighted
to see them.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
October 31st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday we had the pleasure of having dear Vicky and Fritz
and baby here for two hours, the former well and in such good
looks, as I have not seen her for long. The baby is a love, and
very pretty. We were very glad after a year’s separation to meet
again, and Vicky was so dear and loving. I always admire her
understanding and brightness each time I see her again; and Fritz
so good, so excellent. Bertie and Alix we expect in a day or two
for a short visit. It is very cold, but not unpleasant. I go out
twice a day.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, November 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The little daughter<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> was but a momentary disappointment to
us, which we have quite got over. We console ourselves with the
idea that the little pair will look very pretty together.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We are both very much pleased at the arrangements about Brown
and your pony, and I think it is so sensible. I am sure it will do
you good, and relieve a little the monotony of your out-of-door
existence, besides doing your nerves good. I had long wished you
would do something of the kind; for, indeed, only driving is not
wholesome. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have had two drives, which have done me good. *
* * My mother-in-law has been kindness itself all along&mdash;so
attentive and yet so discreet. I can’t be grateful enough. My good
father-in-law also. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Louis’ mother is to be godmother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span>
because it is customary here to ask some one of the name the child
is to receive to stand on the occasion. We liked Elizabeth on
account of St. Elizabeth being the ancestress of the Hessian as
well as the Saxon House.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We probably go to Carlsruhe on Wednesday, the only place we
can well go to near by; we can’t take an inn at Baden or any thing
of that sort, and we only go for a week or ten days at most. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
I am very well and very careful; all people say I look better, and
have more color than I have had for long, and, indeed, I feel
strong and well, and my fat baby does perfectly, and is a great
darling. Affie and Louis and his brother are out shooting. The
horrid weather has kept me in these three days.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 29th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I ought to mention the christening. My mother-in-law held
baby all the time, and it screamed a good deal. Victoria stood with
us and was very good, only kneeling down and tumbling over the
footstool every two minutes, and she kept whispering to me, “Go to
Uncle’s.” I thought so much of the christening last year, when
Victoria behaved much better than her larger dark sister. Ella
measured twenty-three and a half inches a fortnight ago, and she
had not grown then. Victoria, I believe, was twenty inches.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Carlsruhe</span>, December 5th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Dear Dr. Macleod is coming with Affie to Darmstadt for the
14th. Vicky and Fritz will be with us also. How kind of him to
come, and it has made Affie so happy, for he is so devoted to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 10th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We returned here yesterday, after a very pleasant stay at
Carlsruhe. It was very quiet, and we were always <i>en famille</i>. We
had the opportunity of speaking much with Fritz, who is in every
way so distinguished, and dear Louise is so good and kind.</p>

<p>I have very little time to write to-day, as we arrived late last
night. Louis has to be absent to-day, so I have a great deal to do.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>I had not a moment to myself to write to you yesterday, and to
thank you for the kind lines you sent me through dear Dr. Macleod.
He gave us a most beautiful service, a sermon giving an outline of
dear Papa’s noble, great and good character, and there were most
beautiful allusions to you in his prayer, in which we all prayed
together most earnestly for you, precious Mama!</p>

<p>We talked long together afterward about dear Papa, and about you,
and though absent were very near you in thought and prayer.</p>

<p>Dear Vicky talked so lovingly and tenderly of you, and of how
homesick she sometimes felt. She was not with us on that dreadful
day three years ago, and that is so painful to her. Dear Affie was,
as we all were, so much overcome by all Dr. Macleod said. Vicky,
Affie, Louis, and myself sat in the little dining-room; he read to
us there. Fritz had left early in the morning. The day was passed
quietly and peaceably together, and I was most grateful to have
dear Vicky and Affie with me on that day. My dear Louis wishes me
to express to you how tenderly he thought of you and with what
sympathy on this sad anniversary. Never can we<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span> cease talking of
home, of you and of all your trials. God bless and comfort you, my
own dear Mama!</p></div>

<h3><a name="yr-1865" id="yr-1865">1865</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the month of January of this year the Prince and Princess were at
last able to carry out their intentions of visiting Berlin, which had
several times been postponed. The Princess met with the greatest
kindness and attention from the King and Queen of Prussia, who had been
much attached to her since her childhood.</p>

<p>A great grief fell upon the Grand Ducal family through the death of the
young Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Prince Louis’ only sister,
whose recent marriage had given so much satisfaction to the family, and
who died on the 16th of April, a few days after giving birth to a
daughter.</p>

<p>About the same time, the Cesarewitch Nicholas, eldest son of the Emperor
of Russia, died at Nice. He was his mother’s favorite son, and had been
engaged to be married to Princess Dagmar of Denmark (present Empress of
Russia), the sister of the Princess of Wales. Princess Alice endeavored
with all a daughter’s love and sympathy to cheer her parents-in-law
under their heavy bereavement.</p>

<p>While the Prince and Princess were absent in Switzerland at the Riga
Kaltbad in the Bernese Alps, Queen Victoria spent one day at
Kranichstein, and on the 26th of August gathered all her children<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span> round
her at Coburg. On that day the Prince Consort’s statue on the
market-place at Coburg was unveiled.</p>

<p>The yearly visit to England took place in the autumn, and the Prince and
Princess spent a longer time than usual in the Highlands, where they
made many delightful excursions.</p>

<p>Soon after their return to Germany, the sad news reached them of the
death of the King of the Belgians. Endeared by his personal character to
his family and friends, he was also by reason of his statesmanlike
qualities recognized as one of the most remarkable sovereigns of Europe.</p>

<p>Although Princess Alice had lived but a short time at Darmstadt, she had
already become the acknowledged centre of social life in that town. Her
liberal and independent spirit, conflicting as it did with many local
prejudices, exposed her to many criticisms; still, no one who came in
contact with her could resist the charm of her appearance and manner.
The Princess had, so to speak, not “yet taken root” in her adopted
country; but, acute and close observer as she was, she soon found where
her own sphere of occupation lay, and what the agencies were by which
she could work out her plans.</p>

<p>Her letters show the love she bore to her new family, and the many
useful enterprises which she now initiated for the well being of the
country.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Thousand thanks for your dear words<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span> and for the wishes! I
was thinking so much of you and of home, when your letter came in.
It made me so happy! Darling Mama, I can feel so much with and for
you during these days. I was all day on the verge of tears, for the
very word “<i>Neujahr</i>” brought Papa and Grandmama, and all at
Windsor as in former days, so vividly before me, it made my heart
ache! That bright happy past, particularly those last years, when I
was the eldest at home, and had the privilege of being so much with
you both, my own dearly loved parents, is a remembrance deeply
graven, and with letters of gold, upon my heart. All the morning I
was telling Louis how it used to be at home, and how we all
assembled outside your dressing-room door to scream in chorus
“<i>Prosit Neujahr</i>!” and to give to you and Papa our drawings,
writings, etc., the busy occupation of previous weeks. Then playing
and reciting our pieces, where we often stuck fast, and dear Papa
bit his lip so as not to laugh; our walk to the riding-school
[where the alms to the poor were distributed], and then to
Frogmore. Those were happy days, and the very remembrance of them
must bring a gleam of sunshine even to you, dear Mama. Those two
dinners, when I was with you both, were such happy evenings. I am
so grateful I remained at home, and lost not a day of those happy
ones.</p>

<p>At eight this morning we two went to church; at half-past three
there was a large dinner at the Schloss. I wore the bracelet with
your pictures, as I always do on all particular days, for I like to
be able to look at those dear faces.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>We mean to go out sledging. The cold, and all the ground being
white this last month, has given<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> me such bad eyes. I can do
nothing of an evening at all, and reading even by daylight makes
them so bad that they get quite red. The ladies read to me,
instead, all sorts of instructive things. Louis has already found
time to read through a whole volume of the “Lives of the
Engineers.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> You could not have sent any thing that would
interest him more. He thanks you so much for the pretty New Year’s
wish also.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>Thousand thanks for your dear letter, for the nice enclosure from
Dr. Macleod, and for the beautiful sermon by Dean Stanley. One
remark struck me as singularly applicable to dear Papa, where he
says: “To die is gain; to be no longer vexed with the sight of
evil, which they cannot control,” etc.&mdash;for dear Papa <i>suffered</i>
when he saw others do wrong; it pained that good pure spirit: and
though we long for him and want him, if we could call him
back&mdash;even you who want him so much, I think would pause before you
gave vent to the wish that would recall him. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>When trials come, what alone save faith and hope in a blessed
future can sustain one!</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;You can’t think how much I am interested in every little
detail of your daily life. Besides, you know it cannot be
otherwise. Please say kindest things to Brown,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> who must be a
great convenience to you.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The more one studies and tries to understand those wonderful
laws which rule the world, the more one wonders, worships, and
admires that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span> which to us is so incomprehensible; and I always
wonder how there can be dissatisfied and grumbling people in this
beautiful world, so far too good for our deserts, and where, after
our duty is done, we hope to be everlastingly with those we love,
where the joy will be so great and lasting that present sorrow and
trouble must melt away before that sunshine.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We have rain and warm high wind, and leave at four o’clock
this afternoon. Ella has her bath as a bed, and Victoria sleeps in
the bassinet, which is done up with chintz for the occasion. I
don’t think they can catch cold. There is a stove in the centre
compartment besides. You can fancy I feel shy going to Berlin into
a perfectly new society; and I have been so little out on the whole
since the year 1861. Marie Grancy<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> goes with us.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, January 29th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The journey went off very well, and we are so happy to be
here. Vicky and Fritz are kindness itself, and Vicky so dear, so
loving! I feel it does me good, that there is a reflection of
Papa’s great mind in her. He loved her so much, and was so proud of
her. The King is, as always, very kind, and so pleased to see us
here. Louis is very happy to meet his old comrades again, and they
equally so to see him; and I am so glad that he can have this
amusement at least, for he is so kind in not leaving me&mdash;and our
life must be rather dull sometimes for a young man of spirit like
him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, February 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Affie arrived at eight this morning. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span> am sure the King will
be so pleased at your having let him come now. He is so kind to me;
it touches me very much, for I have never done any thing to deserve
it.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, February 4th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have not been sight-seeing anywhere, as it is too cold for
that. We drive in a shut carriage, and then walk in the
Thiergarten. We spend the whole day together, which is a great
enjoyment to me, and of an evening we go out together. It is so
pleasant to have a sister to go out with, and all the people are so
kind and civil to us.</p>

<p>Sigismund<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> is the greatest darling I have ever seen&mdash;so
wonderfully strong and advanced for his age&mdash;with such fine color,
always laughing, and so lively he nearly jumps out of our arms.</p>

<p>This house is very comfortable, and Vicky is surrounded with
pictures of you and dear Papa&mdash;near her bed, on all her tables&mdash;and
such endless souvenirs of our childhood: it made me quite
<i>wehmüthig</i> [sad] to see all the things I had not seen for seven
years, and since we lived together as children&mdash;souvenirs of
Christmases and birthdays from you both, and from dear Grandmama,
from Aunt Gloucester, etc. It awakened a thousand old remembrances
of happy past times.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, February 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How much do I think of you now, the happy Silver Wedding that
would have been, where you could have been surrounded by so many of
us! Poor Mama, I do feel so deeply for you. Oh, may I be long, if
not altogether, spared so awful a calamity!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span></p>

<p>Morning, noon, and night do I thank the Almighty for <i>our</i>
happiness, and pray that it may last.</p>

<p>These lines are for the dear 10th,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> though they will reach you
on the eve; and they are to tell you from Louis and myself how
tenderly we think of you on that day, and of darling Papa, who made
that day what it was. It will be a day of great trial to you, I
fear. May the Almighty give you strength and courage to bear it! I
am sure the dear sisters and brothers who are at home will try to
cheer you with their different loving ways&mdash;above all, little
Beatrice, the youngest of us all.</p>

<p>Louis goes to Schwerin to-morrow until Friday. They wanted us to go
together, but one journey is enough at this time of the year.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, February 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We have been sledging these two days; it is very cold, and
the rooms mostly very hot. When we go out of an evening, we are
packed up from head to foot. My dear Louis returned from Schwerin
at five this morning, pleased with his visit. He found the Castle
fine and comfortable, and its inmates very happy.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, February 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We leave next Saturday. I shall be so sorry to leave dear
Vicky, for she is often so much alone. Fritz is really so
excellent, it is a pleasure to look at his dear good face; and he
is worked so hard&mdash;no health can stand it in the long run.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, February 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;This will be my last letter from here, and I only regret
leaving here on account of parting with dear Vicky and Fritz, whom
we see so rarely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span> and usually but for a short time. I have passed
such pleasant hours with dear Vicky: that is what I shall look back
to with so much pleasure and satisfaction.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, February 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>I write once more from our dear little home, which I find very
cold; snow and ice everywhere still&mdash;it seems as if winter would
never end. We accomplished our journey very well. Poor Vicky will
miss us very much, I fear, in the many hours when she is alone, and
which we spent together. Writing does not make up for it.</p>

<p>We give a large masked ball in the Palace at Fastnacht [Shrove
Tuesday], which is to-day week. It is the first thing we do for the
society, and I hope it will go off well. I found so much to do
since my return that I can write no more.</p>

<p>Before closing I must mention though, that yesterday evening I
heard “Elijah” beautifully given. How I thought of dear Papa!
Nearly every note brought back to mind observations he made about
it. I thought I could see him, and hear his dear sweet voice
turning round to me with quite watery eyes, saying, “<i>Es ist doch
gar zu schön</i>” [“It is really quite too lovely.”]</p>

<p>Adored Papa! how he loved this fine music; the harmony in it seems
like the harmony of souls, and Mendelssohn’s music is so good,
<i>fromm</i> [pious]&mdash;I mean, it makes one better to hear it. In the
second part, in an air of “Elijah” toward the end, I found the part
from which those beautiful responses are taken which Cusins
arranged, and which Papa liked so much.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
February 27th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I can write but a very short letter to-day, having so much to
do for our ball. I have made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span> sketch of my costume, which is the
same I wore at Berlin at the masked ball at Putbuses. Louis wears
part of the Garter Costume.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;My parents-in-law leave the middle of this month for
Schwerin. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;My mother-in-law fears that Anna will be badly
managed and treated quite after the old fashion, and she won’t be
able to help her, she fears. Anna is not very strong, and if she is
starved and kept from the air, it will certainly do her harm.</p>

<p>I have written to dear Tilla.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> To think of home without her
seems too sad, but I hope you will invite her sometimes. Every one
liked her in the house, she was so gentle and so kind. I shall
never forget what I owe her, and I ever loved her most dearly. But
she has never been the same again since 1861. It gave her a
dreadful shock; she had such a veneration for darling Papa.</p>

<p>I hope this year we can show you our house, though it will not be
far enough advanced for you to live in. For another year, I hope,
we could make you so comfortable.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, March 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am reading at this moment a book by Herr von Arneth&mdash;the
publication of letters from Maria Theresa to Marie Antoinette from
1770-80. I recommend it to you. The letters are short and
interesting, and it would amuse you to take it up now and then,
when you have a leisure moment. The advice the Empress gives her
daughter is so good; she was a very wise mother.</p>

<p>I have read and studied a great deal about the human body; about
children&mdash;their treatment, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span> It interests me immensely.
Besides, it is always useful to know such things, so that one is
not perfectly ignorant of the reasons why doctors wish one to do
certain things, and why not. In any moment of illness, before there
is time for a doctor to come, one can be able to help one’s self a
little. I know you don’t like these things, and where one is
surrounded by such as dear Sir James [Clark] and Dr. Jenner, it is
perfectly unnecessary and pleasanter <i>not</i> to know a good deal.
Instead of finding it disgusting, it only fills me with admiration
to see how wonderfully we are made.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, March 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Westerweller does not accompany us this time to England; he
may join us in June. A former playfellow of Louis, Ferdinand
Rabenau, accompanies us. Affie knows him and likes him. We think of
starting on the 3d, and passing by Brussels to see dear Uncle
Leopold. Uncle Louis is still at Nice, and does not return here, it
seems, until the Emperor and Empress meet for April 24th&mdash;the
Emperor’s birthday. My mother-in-law is very grateful for your kind
message. She seems very nervous about Anna.</p>

<p>Victoria is teething, which makes her pale and poorly. Ella’s
vaccination did <i>not</i> take, and we have the small-pox here.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 18th.<br />
</p>

<p>My poor children have been confined to the house with dreadful
colds and coughs. Victoria looks the most pulled, though Ella’s
cough was much more violent. I am happy to say that they are really
better to-day; but we have snow every day, and that makes their
recovery slower.</p>

<p>Yesterday night part of a large seed manufactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span> close by, near
the artillery barracks, was burnt down. The flames were enormous,
but the damage done was not great.</p>

<p>My parents-in-law are in Berlin, and after to-morrow they go to
Schwerin.</p>

<p>Last night we heard <i>Cosi fan tutte</i> given to perfection. The music
is most charming, and I had never heard it before.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Since some days the snow is many feet deep; one can get about
in sledges, and Louis drove me in one with four horses this
morning. All intercourse by carriage is impossible, and this is
very inconvenient to the people in the country where their “Post”
cannot drive.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 4th.<br />
</p>

<p>I must begin by telling you how much pleasure your telegram has
given me. It is like my own dear Mama to have her arms open for
those who want her kind support; and I can only repeat again, that
with you, and under your care alone, should I like to leave my
little ones so long! To them, indeed, it will in every way be an
advantage, and I shall be quite easy in leaving them there, where I
know they will have every care which can be given; and it would
make us both so happy to feel that in this way we could give you
some little pleasure.</p>

<p>Westerweller and Becker both wish very much we may take this
winter, D.V., for a journey. As long as we have fewer servants and
this small house, it is easy to break up the whole
establishment&mdash;later, this will be less possible. Louis has never
been able to travel, and the advantage of seeing other parts of the
world would be so great for him. Without me he would not do it; he
says, alone he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span> should not enjoy it. I urge this journey
principally for his sake, and I hope you will support me in this.
Since our marriage we have seen nothing, and all who can try to
enlarge their knowledge. From books alone it becomes tedious and
less advantageous.</p>

<p>Victoria is going to have a party of thirty children to-morrow in
Prince Charles’ rooms. The snow is thawing at length, and the sun
is much too hot. The sudden spring is not pleasant. We have been
out riding, and this evening I shall accompany Louis to the
Schnepfenstrich [woodcock-shooting<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>], which in a fine evening,
when the birds sing, is lovely.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We shall be delighted to receive you in Kranichstein, and if
you will send your suite all to Darmstadt we shall be able to
arrange, though we have not one spare room anywhere, and I feel you
will be rather squeezed. How I look forward to meeting you again,
after a year of separation, I can’t say; and I am so glad that it
will be under our roof that our joyful embrace will take place. As
Uncle Louis is to have the Garter, may not Affie bring it to him
<i>without</i> ceremony? He would like it so much better if it can be
so.</p>

<p>On the 17th Louis goes to Oberhessen to shoot <i>capercailzies</i>, and
he deposits me and the children at Lich on his way, where he will
join us again for my birthday.</p>

<p>Anna was safely delivered of a little girl this morning, and is
doing well.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 15th.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We have been very anxious about Anna<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> the last few days,
for she has had fever since the 9th, and shivering still yesterday.</p>

<p>We have a great deal to do this morning, so I can write but
shortly.</p>

<p>We have fine weather at length, and are out a great deal.</p>

<p>Yesterday we took the Sacrament at nine, and numbers of people with
us. The service lasted till past eleven, with a pause between.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 18th.<br />
</p>

<p>This is really a dreadfully sad death in our family, and will be a
blow to my dear parents-in-law, which will weigh them down for many
a day. They who lived so retired, and to whom the family life was
all&mdash;Anna, the pet&mdash;“<i>das Prinzesschen</i>,” whom they gave up so
unwillingly, and with whom they corresponded daily! It will be a
blank in their existence, which I can’t bear to think of! Such
tender loving parents! My poor Louis was dreadfully distressed,
though he feared the worst all along since we knew that Anna had
fever. He left with Grolmann, having passed a dreadful morning. All
the old servants, tutors, friends, came crying to us. Since he is
gone I have passed sad lonely hours; and poor old Amelung comes<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
and sits in my room, sobbing that she should ever have lived to see
this day.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I went to the Rosenhahe and picked flowers from
Anna’s garden, and wound a large wreath, which I have sent to Louis
to place on her coffin. The three brothers feel it dreadfully&mdash;the
first rent in the family circle is always hard to bear, and she so
young, so good, so happy! I hear the poor little baby is nice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span></p>

<p>Yesterday night Anna was taken into the Schlosskirche [Palace
Chapel] upon Louis’ arrival, after a journey of twenty-seven hours.
I hope he won’t be ill after all this <i>Gemüthsbewegung</i> [strain
upon his feelings], and fatigue always upsets him and makes him
sick, and he feels all so deeply and warmly. It is so shocking. I
can think of nothing else; and I am very low and sad being so
alone, and the warm weather makes one unwell.</p>

<p>The poor Cesarewitch has passed a tolerable night. I fear he is so
reduced he can’t get through it. The Empress doats on this son, and
he is so like her. The poor Emperor has left for Nice.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>Oh, it is sad, very sad! Life indeed is but a short journey, on
which we have our duty to do, and in which joy and sorrow
alternately prevail. Anna was very good, very unselfish, and a true
Christian, with her gentle, humble spirit, and as such she was
loved and admired. What rare people my parents-in-law and their
children are, I can’t tell you&mdash;such childlike faith, such pure
unselfish love to each other; I really feel unworthy to belong to
them, and they are dear to me beyond description. As I have shared
their joys, so with all my heart do I share their sorrow, and
fervently pray for them! You will understand this, darling Mama.
From you I have inherited an ardent and sympathizing spirit, and
feel the pain of those I love as though it were my own. To-morrow I
have wished that there should be in the Palace Chapel a funeral
service at the same time as the funeral at Schwerin, and all the
people here seemed pleased at my wish. Bender, who taught her,
confirmed her, and who married her not a year ago in that very
church, will perform the service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span></p>

<p>Poor Dagmar! what a journey for her, poor child! She begins her
troubles early enough.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Many thanks for your kind letter, and for all the kind wishes
for my birthday. It will be sad and quiet; but I hope my beloved
Louis will arrive to-night, and be with me again&mdash;such cause for
joy and thankfulness. When I have <i>him</i>, all sorrow is turned into
peace and happiness. Could I but know you still had darling Papa at
your side, how light would my heart be! Once when we have all
fulfilled our allotted duties, and overcome that dark night, then,
please God, we shall be together, never again to part!</p>

<p>The sympathy of all does my sorrowing family good, for it soothes
so much! I had a few lines so tender, so full of faith, from my
dear mother-in-law to-day. Since Ella’s birth I know to understand
and love her most dearly. She suffered dreadfully, but no complaint
passes her lips. She consoles her husband, her son-in-law, and
this, with prayer, enables her to bear that which has almost broken
her heart.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Dear Louis returned last night well, and bringing good
accounts of his parents. They remain there still a little longer,
to arrange Anna’s things. At Frankfort, at eleven last night, we
met; it was so warm.</p>

<p>The poor Cesarewitch is gone! The Emperor and Empress are coming
here in ten days; what sad meetings.</p>

<p>How warm it has been daily since a fortnight, I can’t tell you! We
sit all day in the garden, take tea there, drawing-lessons, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
April 29th.<br />
</p>

<p>I thank you so much for your kind sympathizing letter. All my
family are so grateful for all the kindness and sympathy you have
shown them on this sad occasion.</p>

<p>To-day Uncle Louis arrives; on Monday the Emperor and Empress, and
children. What a sad meeting! They go to Jugenheim direct, where
last year they were so happy all together. I hear the Empress is
worn out, mind and body; and she insists, instead of finishing her
cure, on going in a fortnight to St. Petersburg to meet the remains
of her child, and to do him the last honors. Louis fears that it
will be more than her feeble frame can endure. In the Greek Church,
too, the night Masses are long and exhausting, and she is sure to
wish to do all.</p>

<p>We spent my birthday as every other day, and the weather was
heavenly. I am painting in oil now, and that interests me much. I
find it much easier than water-colors.</p>

<p>I hope Affie will come to pay his respects to the Russians. If you
send them a kind message through him, it would please them much.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How well I understand your compassion being alike for
mourners in all positions of life. It is but right and natural, and
I can’t imagine one’s feeling otherwise.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>To-morrow morning my poor parents-in-law arrive. What a meeting,
and what a return! My father-in-law and the Empress<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> are each
other’s favorites, and understand each other so perfectly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span> It will
be a consolation to both to pour their hearts out to each other,
and share each other’s sorrow. My dear father-in-law wrote to Aunt
Marie: “Although my heart is sorely depressed, yet it is even more
filled with gratitude than with sorrow, that the dear God has given
us two such dear children, though but for a brief space.” He is so
touching in his grief.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>I find my dear parents-in-law pretty well, but poor Mama so
terribly tired. She was dreadfully overcome in coming home, and at
the several meetings. He looks much older, as, indeed, does also
the poor Emperor, who parted yesterday to go to St. Petersburg.
Dear Aunt Marie seems very weak, and they both, together with my
parents, make such a sad picture to look at. But they all like to
speak of those they have lost. My parents-in-law and we go this
week to Uncle Louis, to Seeheim for three weeks.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Seeheim</span>, May 12th.<br />
</p>

<p>You can’t think what real pleasure your pretty locket gave my
mother-in-law. She was deeply touched by the kind thought and the
considerate attention of the gift&mdash;with what was engraved on it.
She was so very much pleased with it, and put it on the moment she
received it. The photograph is to be put in. To-day, Anna’s
wedding-day, it arrived.</p>

<p>We have been here since yesterday afternoon&mdash;my parents-in-law and
Uncle Louis. The suite are on leave of absence, so we are quite <i>en
famille</i>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Serge’s birthday, we went with Uncle and Aunt to the
Greek Mass, which lasted more than an hour. We dine daily at the
Heiligenberg. This morning also we were there with our parents and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span>
children; and Aunt Marie [the Empress of Russia] kept Ella half an
hour on her lap, playing with her, which the little one enjoyed
very much, as she is particularly sociable and amiable. Victoria
romped with her cousins&mdash;Aunt Marie’s two, and Uncle Alexander’s
four.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Seeheim</span>, May 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To-day Michael and Cécile arrive, and on Tuesday the Emperor
and Empress recommence their journey homeward. The return will be
for both most trying. Aunt Marie spoke with me about her sons,
their education, etc., very long last night. Her whole life she has
studied and lived for Nike [the late Cesarewitch], that he might
become that which was necessary for his future; and she was much
more with him, and they were both much more intimate together, than
she is with her other children. Affie came here on Saturday, and I
am so glad to have him and hear some news of you. At this moment he
and William are in the room shooting at a target out of the window,
which makes no little noise.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We mean to remain here in the Bergstrasse with our parents;
is seems to console them; but my father-in-law makes me very
anxious, and is so nervous. Poor Mama! so soft, so tired, so unlike
herself, <i>cela fait pitié</i>.</p>

<p>On the fifth the Grand Duke is going to receive the Garter. You
shall have an account of all.</p>

<p>Affie is here, and to-day dear Arthur comes for a few hours. I
shall be so pleased to see him again.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Seeheim</span>, May 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday the Emperor and Empress and children left. So sorry
to see them go! God<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span> knows when we shall all meet here again. We
have been so much together and so intimately, that I have grown
very fond of them, and am very sad at the thought of the long and
uncertain separation. Dear little Arthur was here, looking very
well. The wooded hills here are so nice to ride about on, and the
country is very beautiful.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 31st.<br />
</p>

<p>I read serious books a great deal, and of a Sunday together we read
out of Robertson’s sermons. In the second series there is one, “The
Irreparable Past” for young people, so cheering, so encouraging, so
useful. Louis read it to me on his return from Schwerin after poor
Anna’s death. A short life indeed, and it makes one feel the
uncertainty of life, and the necessity of labor, self-denial,
charity, and all those virtues which we ought to strive after. Oh,
that I may die, having done my work and not sinned with
<i>Unterlassung des Guten</i> [omission to do what is good], the fault
into which it is easiest to fall.</p>

<p>Our life being so quiet gives one much time for earnest thought,
and I own it is discouraging to find how much one fails&mdash;how small
the step of improvement is.</p>

<p>I suffer still so much, and so often, from rheumatism. I am taking
warm soda-baths in the morning for it, and am rubbed afterward with
towels which have been dipped in cold water and then wrung out. It
is not very pleasant.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 4th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The weather is very beautiful, and we had tea yesterday at
Schönberg, the castle of young Count Erbach, whom Louis presented
to you at Windsor. Could you tell us for certain when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span> intend
going to Coburg, and when we are expected there, as we are going to
the sea to bathe for Victoria and myself, and we would arrange our
time accordingly? I require some sea air after the great heat, and
after baby’s weaning; also before Scotland it would be good, for I
have so much rheumatism. Some sea water will strengthen me.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;You know how very Scotch we both are. Louis is devotedly
attached to Scotland and his Scotch friends. Do tell them so
always. But now I must tell you of yesterday. In the morning Affie,
we, and our suite, drove into town for the investiture. At half
past three I drove with my ladies, a Kammerherr [Chamberlain],
Becker, etc., to the Schloss, where Uncle Louis received us in
<i>shorts</i>! Then Affie and Louis in their whole Garter dress arrived
in a carriage with six horses and an escort. Uncle Louis, before
the throne, and the family, Court, corps diplomatique, etc.,
received them. Affie read in English the address, to which Uncle
Louis answered in German; then Affie buckled on the Garter; then
Louis helped him to put on ribbon, cloak, etc., and fastened the
sword on him, which was no easy task; but they acquitted themselves
to perfection, and went out through the long Kaisersaal backward,
bowing.</p>

<p>There was a large dinner afterward, at which your health was
proposed by Uncle Louis, and in return Affie gave his. You have
made a happy man, and he feels the honor&mdash;as he said to me in
English&mdash;“utmostly”; and he wishes me to repeat once more how
grateful he is to you. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Affie did not return here last night; he slept at <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span>Darmstadt, and
left this morning for Amorbach. To-day Uncle Ernest is coming to
us, but only for one night. As we have again to go into town to
fetch him, and it is very warm, I must close.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Seeheim</span>, June 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How it will amuse and please us to show the good excellent
Scotchman our home. It is a pleasure to hear of such devotion and
attention to you as Brown’s is, and indeed you are so kind to him,
that his whole happiness must consist in serving so good a
mistress.</p>

<p>I think you will be pleased to hear of a most kind and touching
tribute which the Frauen [women] of Darmstadt have paid me. Two
hundred and fifty have subscribed to have a splendid picture
painted for me, by P. Weber, of Loch Katrine. I am to see it on
Sunday. It is very much admired, and they sent the painter to
Scotland to do it, thinking that something from my own country
would please me most. Is it not kind of them? It has given me so
much pleasure&mdash;but of all things the feeling which has prompted
them to do it, as it shows me that, though I have been here so
short a time, they have become attached to me, as I am with all my
heart to my new home and country.</p>

<p>Now about myself. I have weaned Ella, last Saturday, and can say
that my health has never been so good, nor have I been so strong or
looked so fresh and healthy as I do now. When Uncle Ernest saw me
he said I looked again as I did as a girl, only rather fatter.</p>

<p>Ella crawls now, and is very strong; she has her first two teeth.
Victoria is very wild, and speaks more German than English. I think
her rather small, but other people say she is not. She goes out
walking with her Papa before breakfast quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span> alone, with her hands
in her pockets, and amuses him very much.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>Many thanks for your last letter from dear Balmoral. The parting
from that lovely place must always be sad, and there is something
in mountains which attaches one so much to that scenery.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a very trying day for my poor mother-in-law (her
birth-day), and she was very low, but, as all along, so resigned,
so touching in the beautiful way she bears her grief; so unselfish
with it, never wishing to make others sad, or to be less interested
in their concerns than formerly.</p>

<p>Dear Mary Cambridge has been here, and we enjoyed her visit so
much. We took her back to Frankfort to-day, where we gave her and
Aunt Cambridge a luncheon in Uncle Louis’ Palais.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>It is warm, but very windy and dusty here; we were nearly blinded
out riding yesterday evening. I am reading that most interesting
History of England by Pauli, in German, which commences with the
Congress of Vienna in 1815, and is, I believe, very detailed and
correct. It gives a sketch also of the reign of George III., and is
so well written one can scarcely lay the book down. It is part of a
work written by the best German professors on England, Russia,
Italy, France, Spain, and Austria in those years, and I am reading
them one after another. They are thick books, and eight volumes.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, July 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>We both thank you for your kind wishes for our wedding-day. It was
rainy and not fine, but we spent it very happily indoors&mdash;Affie and
Mary with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span> us. Dr. Weber now wishes (as we should have to go from
Blankenberghe back to Coburg, and then again all the journey back),
that I should not bathe at all this year, as all the good would be
undone by the hurried journey, and the excitement of the sea air
might not be good for Victoria. We are all to go instead for four
weeks to Switzerland, beginning with Rigi Kaltbad, and this we
greatly prefer. We go into the mountains at once for the bracing
air. On Saturday until Tuesday we go to Baden for the christening
of the baby. We both are god-parents.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, July 10th.<br />
</p>

<p>*** Ella already says, since some time, “Papa” and “Mama,” and
calls herself, and crawls, and is very forward and merry&mdash;such a
contrast to Victoria, who is so pale and fair, and <i>now</i> thin, for
Ella’s eyes are so dark blue, and her hair of such a rich brown,
that you would never take the little things for sisters. They are
very fond of each other, and so dear together, that they give us
much pleasure. I would not change them for boys, if I could; this
little pair of sisters is so nice, and they can be such friends to
each other.</p>

<p>I hope you will be comfortable here, but we are much annoyed not to
be able to be there to receive you. None of the family will be
here, save perhaps my mother-in-law with poor Fritz Schwerin, who
is expected then.</p>

<p>We mean to start on the 25th, and we go as private people, on
account of the expense. We are only going to Oberland, and sha’n’t
go very far about.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, July 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>*** It was 95° in the shade yesterday at eight in the morning, and
I think the heat increases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span> Dr. Lyon Playfair lunched with us
yesterday; he is so charming. To-morrow morning at five we go to
Bonn for the day, and shall be there before ten. The heat is too
great to go at any other time. We start next Tuesday evening, and
on Wednesday shall be on the Rigi.</p>

<p>This morning at six o’clock we rode to the exercising&mdash;I on a new
horse, for two hours and a half over sand without any shade.</p>

<p>Mary [Duchess of Teck] has been so kind as to give us a boat, which
we expect shortly. It is to be christened “Mary Adelaide,” after
her.</p></div>

<p>Many thanks for your letter, and for the sad account of Victoria
Brant’s<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> death. It is quite shocking, and she was my dearest
friend of those contemporaries, and the one I saw the most of. “In
the midst of life we are in death”; and the uncertainty of all
earthly things makes life a real earnest, and no dream. Our whole
life should be a preparation and expectation for eternity. Merry as
she was, she was yet very serious and thoughtful; but what a loss
she will be to her poor parents and husband!</p>

<p>I have made all arrangements for your comfort here. I own I do not
like your coming here when we and the whole family are away&mdash;it
looks so <i>odd</i>! I forgot to tell you, in answer to your question
about Ella’s name, that she of course must be called “Elizabeth,”
<i>entre nous</i> only “Ella,” for she bears my dear mama-in-law’s name.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Rigi Kaltbad</span>, August 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>I am enchanted, delighted with this magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span> scenery. Oh, how
you would admire it! When I am sketching, I keep telling Louis how
much more like you would make the things; one can always recognize
the places when you draw them.</p>

<p>We left Darmstadt at eight Wednesday morning, the 26th, slept at
Basel that night, and we got there early enough to see the fine
church in a thunder storm. The next day we only went to Lucerne, as
the weather was not fine enough to ascend the Rigi. It was a lovely
afternoon, and the lake of a marvellous green color. The Pilatus
was quite clear for a few hours. The next morning we two, the
children, Moffat, Harriet the nursery-maid, Logoz and wife, Jäger,
and Beck, our whole party, started in a very crowded steamer for
Wäggis. Splendid weather, though cloudy. We then, on horses and in
chairs carried by three or six men, made our ascent along a
winding, narrow, steep path, below rocks, past ravines, where
little châlets are situated, and all over the green pasture cows
and goats feeding with bells round their necks. Westerweller was
here when we arrived; he acts courier, and when we make long
expeditions remains with the children. This is a very roomy hotel,
crammed full of people, among them some odd Austrian ladies whom we
see below walking on the terrace&mdash;very smart, and smoking. We two
have been on mules with a guide&mdash;such a funny man, who was a
soldier at Naples, and was at the siege of Gaeta&mdash;on all the
expeditions hereabout.</p>

<p>To-morrow we leave, and go till Monday to Buochs, on the other side
of the lake; then to Engelberg, where Uncle Adalbert and his wife
will be. The children are well; Victoria very troublesome, but Ella
good and amiable as ever. As I am writing at the window, the clouds
cover the lake and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span> lower mountains, and I can only see the
quite high ones with glaciers, which are of such a splendid shape.</p>

<p>The color of the Scotch mountains is, I think, finer; but here they
are, first of all, so enormously high, and then such fine shapes,
and the mountains are studded with trees and rocks down below, and
of a green color.</p>

<p>The air is very light and cold, but the sun intense. We are going
off for the day again on our mules, so I must close. Of course many
funny incidents take place, which I reserve to tell you when we
meet.</p>

<p>I do hope the heat will be over for your journey, and that it will
be fine when you are at our dear Kranichstein. Marie Grancy will be
there to receive you, and do any thing which is required.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Engelberg</span>, <span class="smcap">Hotel Titlis</span>, August 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>These lines I send by Becker, and hope you will receive them at
Kranichstein. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I hope you found all you wanted in the rooms,
and that the meals were as you like them. I ordered all, and wrote
all down before leaving, as I know what you like.</p>

<p>We were for some days at Buochs, a very pretty village; and we
lived in three detachments in different common Swiss houses, very
comfortable on the whole, but not smelling very nice, so that I
could scarcely eat while we were there.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, in a very funny two-seated carriage with one
horse, we left, the children and servants following in a bigger
carriage. A nearly four hours’ drive through the most beautiful
scenery, up a narrow valley through which the Aa runs, brought us
here. The last two hours are a steep ascent on the side of a
precipice; beautiful vegeta<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span>tion through the wood all the way
upward; view on the high mountains with snow and glaciers close by.
On coming to the top there is a narrow and lovely green valley
studded with peasants’ cottages, and in the centre a Benedictine
Abbey, near which our hotel is situated. The valley is of very
green grass; the tops of the mountains quite rocky, with snow.
Lower down, and skirting the valley, which is quite shut in by the
hills, fine trees; several very high waterfalls, in the style of
the Glassalt (near Balmoral), only much higher. This Alpine valley
is said to give the most perfect idea of a Swiss valley up in the
mountains. One can ascend the Titlis; but it is said to be
dangerous, so we sha’n’t attempt it. We are very careful, and Louis
won’t undertake any thing risky. The scenery seen from the carriage
merely is so splendid that one may well be content with that.
Unfortunately, to-day it pours, and it is very cold. The children
are very well. The journey has really done Victoria good, and she
begins to have an appetite, which with her is a very rare thing.</p>

<p>The next place we go to is Meyringen. We mean to ride there over
the Joch Pass, but the children must go back the same way to get
round, as there is no other way out of this valley. We will leave
them then with Westerweller, and go to the Grindelwald, Interlaken,
etc.; and then return home by the 29th probably. The children are
living in a cottage here also.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Our ride from Engelberg over the Joch Pass to Meyringen was
quite beautiful; but a worse way than any we have ever been out on
in Scotland. We were eleven hours on the road, and the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span> was
very hot, and the walking on these steep bad paths made one still
hotter; but we enjoyed it very much, and I never saw any thing
grander or more magnificent. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have made little scribbles on
the way. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To-day we two with two horses were to have walked
and ridden to the Grindelwald, over the Rosenlaui glacier, and to
have gone on the next day to Interlaken, but the weather is so bad
that it is impossible, and, not being satisfied with the prices,
etc., at the hotel of Meyringen, we came on here, an hour’s drive,
near to the beautiful falls of the Giessbach, which we saw on
Sunday. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The weather will determine whether we can make an
expedition to-morrow.</p>

<p>We shall be home on Friday by Thun and Basel, where we sleep. What
day are we to be at Coburg, and for how long exactly? I believe
only two or three days.</p>

<p>The white heather is from above Engelberg, near Brienz.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Pension Belle Vue</span>, August 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>I have this instant received your dear letter from Kranichstein,
and, though only just returned from an expedition to the Rosenlaui
glacier, I sit down at once to thank you with all my heart for such
dear lines. How glad I am all was comfortable, and that you were
pleased with your day in our nice Kranichstein! I am glad you
missed us a little. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;But I must tell you of to-day. We drove
to Reichenbach, close to the falls, took a guide and horses, and in
two hours by a steep stony path got to Rosenlaui. The view on the
Wetterhorn, covered with snow, and on the Wellhorn, which is a
rugged rock on the other side of it, the white sparkling glacier,
is quite beautiful. The shapes and immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span> height of the mountains
are so imposing. I look, admire, wonder; one can’t find words to
express what one feels. How you would admire the scenery! Papa was
so fond of it all.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, August 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>These will be my last lines until we meet. We returned here well,
having unfortunately, though, much rain from Interlaken to Basel.
At Thun we were in the same hotel as Blanche and Mademoiselle
Bernard, and to-morrow we expect Uncle Nemours, Marguerite, and
Alençon, whom we asked to dinner on their way to Frankfort. I am
mostly at the Rosenhöhe with my mama-in-law, as she is quite alone.
I was in town with her, and read to her this morning; she is ever
so dear and kind. I do love her <i>so much</i>. Ever since Ella’s birth
we have been drawn so closely to each other, and I admire her also
now that I know and understand her. There is so much beneath, so
much <i>Gemüth</i>, tenderness, and delicacy of feeling. It is indeed a
blessing to have such people as they are for parents-in-law.</p></div>

<p>Uncle George was here yesterday. Vicky remains with us till the
5th, and gives me so much pleasure to be able to repay her for her
hospitality this winter.</p>

<p>We were at the christening of Becker’s baby, which went off so
well. In the morning we had to go through High Mass for the
inauguration of the Grand Duchess’ monument in the Catholic church.</p>

<p>Poor papa-in-law, who went to bathe for his headache, has had such
a return of his cough that he is coming back here on Monday. I hope
they will go to Switzerland later.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;After having missed the train they intended, to come by,
Bertie and Alix arrived at three o’clock. They dined with us. Louis
then took him to the theatre, and I drove her about.</p>

<p>My poor father-in-law’s throat is very bad, and gives him much
pain. I am really very anxious about him.</p>

<p>We leave to-morrow afternoon at four, and shall spend the following
day at Ostend, embarking in the evening. Till the end of the week
we intend stopping in town, and if Bertie and Alix remain longer,
we shall leave by the limited mail (for Balmoral).</p></div>

<p>This is a very fine town, and the country is very beautiful. We

out for us.</p>

<p>Again a thousand thanks for having arranged this nice journey for
us, which we enjoy so much. I thought so much of you and dear Papa
yesterday during our ride.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am pleased that the children are well under your roof. I
know they have all they can want. Bertie had such bad toothache
yesterday; Louis also a little; the cold air must be the cause, for
it is so sharp here.</p>

<p>Alix and I practice together for an hour of an evening. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Alix
drove me down to the sea the other day, and a most alarming drive
it was, for the horses pulled, and to our astonishment the coachman
suddenly alighted between us, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span> feet in the air, from the
back seat, and caught hold of the reins&mdash;it was too funny. I hope

travelled quite well so far. May will have told you about our
passage. I have been sick ever since, which is dreadful. Henry and
William joined us at Bonn, and came here with us.</p>

<p>The Queen was most kind. We spent the evening most pleasantly <i>en

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I find my father-in-law looking better, I am happy to say,

Though, with care, one can guard him from evil consequences, still
of course, it is an anxious thing. All the family are very grateful
for your kind messages, and send their respects to you.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The children are very well, and Victoria said to my mother,
“Meine Grossmama, die Königinn, has got a little vatch with a

principally of the things in your room. I am so glad that you are
pleased with the children’s picture. I admire it so much.</p>

<p>It is warm and damp here. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have a great deal to do. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 5th.<br />
</p>

<p>Many thanks for your letter received yesterday, with the account of
Lenchen’s <i>Verlobung</i> [betrothal]. I am so glad she is happy, and I
hope every blessing will rest on them both that one can possibly
desire.</p>

<p>I had a letter from Marie Brabant two days ago, where she says dear
Uncle’s [King Leopold’s] state is hopeless; but yesterday she
telegraphed that he was rather better. What a loss it would be if
he were to be taken from us, for his very name and existence,
though he takes no active part in politics, are of weight and
value.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was painting in oils, and I copied my sketch of the
Sluggan, and, if it be in any way at all presentable and fit to
give, I will send it to you. I hope it won’t be very Chinese, for
our sketches had a certain likeness to works of art of that
country. Louis is very busy here. He has begun his military duties;
he has the command and <i>Verwaltung</i> [administration] of the Cavalry
Brigade. To-day he has to go to the Chamber, and he is going to
attend the different offices&mdash;home department, finances, justice,
etc.,&mdash;so as to get a knowledge of the routine of business. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Louis of Portugal and family passed through here yesterday, and
went to Frankfort. I have inquired if they are there still, and if
they are we shall try to see them. I am so curious to see Marie
Pia. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>All our <i>Hofstaat</i> [Court circle] lay their good wishes for
Lenchen’s engagement at your feet.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>We are so grieved and distressed at dear Uncle Leopold’s alarming
state, and have given up all hope, the accounts are so bad. Oh,
were there but a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span> for you, or for any of us who love him so
dearly, to be near him during his last hours!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>Many thanks for your letter. Alas, alas! beloved Uncle Leopold is
no more! How much for you, for us, for all, goes with him to the
grave! One tie more of those dear old times is rent!</p>

<p>I do feel for you so much, for dear Uncle was indeed a father to
you. Now you are head of all the family&mdash;it seems incredible, and
that dear Papa should not be by your side.</p>

<p>The regret for dear Uncle Leopold is universal&mdash;he stood so high in
the eyes of all parties; his life was a history in itself&mdash;and now
that book is closed. Oh, it is so sad, and he is such a loss! I am
almost glad this sorrow has fallen into those days already so
hallowed by melancholy and precious recollections. How I recollect
every hour, every minute of those days. In thinking of them one
feels over again the hope, the anxiety, and lastly the despair and
grief of that irretrievable loss. The Almighty stood by you and us,
and enabled us to bear it, for I always wonder that we lived
through that awful time.</p>

<p>The future world seems so like a real home, for there are so many
dear ones to meet again. There is something peculiarly sad in the
death of the last one of a large family&mdash;to feel that none is left
to tell of each other, and of their earlier life, which the younger
ones could know only through their lips.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>Many thanks for your letter. I was so anxious to hear something of
our beloved Uncle’s end; it seems to have been most peaceful.</p>

<p>There will be many Princes at Brussels, I believe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span></p>

<p>How much I thought of you and of dear Papa on the 14th! Dear Louis
leaves me this afternoon. He will reach Brussels at five to-morrow
morning, and remain over the Sunday.</p>

<p>The accession of the new King and the honors that have at once to
be paid are so painful, following so closely on the death of one we
have loved and known in that position. As the French say: “<i>Le Roi
est mort. Vive le Roi!</i>”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I was sitting up for Louis till half-past eleven with
Countess Blücher&mdash;who leaves to-day, and has spent a few days with
me&mdash;when he, and to my astonishment Bertie also, came into the
room. The next day, alas! he had to leave again at four; but still,
short as his stay was, it was a token of his constant love for me,
and it touched me very much, for I ever loved him so dearly.</p>

<p>Every thing went off well at Brussels as you will have heard. The
more I realize that we shall never see beloved Uncle Leopold again,
the sadder I grow. He had, apart from all his excellent qualities,
such a charm as I believe we shall seldom find again.</p>

<p>The dear Countess is well. We made the dining-room into a bedroom
for her, and we dined downstairs. I was so afraid of her getting
cold, if she lived out of the house.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How I wish beloved Uncle were brought to Windsor to rest
there as he had wished! I wondered so much that every thing had
taken place at Laeken, knowing that dear Uncle had wished it
otherwise.</p>

<p>Uncle Louis wishes me to thank you once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span> for the Christmas
eatables, and my mother-in-law likewise for the lovely little frame
and photograph. They are both much touched by this kind attention
on your part.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
Christmas Day.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To me Christmas is always sad now, and for Louis and his
family it was so likewise this year; my parents-in-law felt it very
much. We went to the Military Church at eight this morning. It is
the service we like best; but it was bitterly cold, every thing
snow white.</p>

<p>I hope my little picture, though very imperfect, found favor in
your eyes. It gave me such pleasure doing it for you, thinking of
you and our expedition the whole time I was doing it.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 30th.<br />
</p>

<p>This is my last letter this year. In many ways a happy one has it
been, though it has deprived us of many dear and near ones. Each
year brings us nearer to the <i>Wiedersehen</i> [reunion with the dead],
though it is sad to think how one’s glass is running out, and how
little good goes with it compared to the numberless blessings we
receive. Time goes incredibly fast.</p>

<p>Every earnest and tender wish from us both is yours, dear Mama, for
this coming year with its expected events. May God’s blessing rest
on this new union which is to be formed in our family, and may dear
Lenchen be as happy as all those who loved her can wish! I am sorry
to think that I shall probably not see her again until she is
married; but I am glad for her sake that the <i>Brautstand</i> [the
betrothal period] is not to be long.</p>

<p>I send you a locket with Ella’s miniature, which I hope will please
you.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span></p>

 AT HOME AND AT WORK.<br /><br />
1866-1872.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="sml">“Life is meant for work, and not for pleasure.” (<i>August 29, 1866.</i>)</p></div>

<h3><a name="yr-1866" id="yr-1866">1866</a>.</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HIS year, which brought such important changes to the political life of
Germany, was also in many ways full of sorrow and trouble to the
Princess, and the hard and painful struggle through which Germany passed
affected her very nearly.</p>

<p>During the early part of the year, the new palace was completed, and in
it the Princess had the satisfaction of seeing her wishes realized, and
of feeling both comfortable and “at home.” She was also able during this
new year to extend the field of her practical usefulness.</p>

<p>Princess Alice attended some very interesting lectures on the necessity
of providing special asylums for poor idiots, delivered by a very clever
and enterprising “orthodox” clergyman from the Odenwald. She took up the
idea most warmly, and determined to found such an institution herself,
but in doing this found herself face to face with very serious
difficulties. The lecturer and those who sided with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span> wished that any
institution of this kind should bear a strictly religious stamp. The
Princess did not agree in this view. She wished to separate the
religious from the practical part of the work. She wished people to
feel, that they were bound to help to alleviate sickness and suffering
(in whatever form) out of mere love to their fellow-creatures, and not
only as the fulfilment of a religious duty. While the Princess always
acknowledged the value of religious motives in carrying out works of
charity, she felt strongly, in this particular case, that the treatment
of idiots should be left to the medical profession, without any foreign
interference.</p>

<p>A committee was formed of persons who shared the Princess’ views, and
who were commissioned by her to take the necessary steps for carrying
out her plans. By far the most difficult part of the work fell to her
own share&mdash;namely, that of finding the necessary funds. To obtain these
she organized a Bazaar in her new palace. This was a totally novel
proceeding in Germany, and well calculated to attract a large number of
visitors. The Bazaar was opened on the 6th of April, and lasted four
days. The Princess and Prince Louis and her brother, Prince Alfred, took
an active part in it. The result surpassed utmost expectations, a
success mainly due to her own personal efforts, and to the charm which
she exercised over all. At the close of the Bazaar she was not only able
to announce that she had realized the sum of 16,000 florins, but that
she had also gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span> the conviction that the whole country supported her
in her undertaking.</p>

<p>In spite of the success of this Bazaar, the Princess was in later years
opposed to a repetition of such an expedient, as she felt&mdash;what many
do&mdash;that people often come on such occasions for their own personal
amusement rather than to aid the charity.</p>

<p>The war of 1866, which was the consequence of the unfortunate conflict
about the Duchies of Schleswig-Holstein, was viewed by the Princess with
feelings in which personal interests and attachments conflicted with
political convictions. She was so truly German that she felt most keenly
the struggle between Germans and Germans, or as she herself says in one
of her letters, “brother against brother.”</p>

<p>At times she could not help being downcast, because she saw how much her
husband and her husband’s country suffered from it, and because she
foresaw how disastrous to South Germany the results of such a war must
be. Prince Louis himself was soon obliged to assume his command in the
field.</p>

<p>The Princess gave birth to a third daughter on the 11th of July, during
the most anxious days of that trying time. Prince Louis had happened to
be home on leave for a few days when the event took place; but he was
obliged to leave the Princess on the 14th of July, and to go at once
into action at Aschaffenburg. As the South-German troops had to retreat,
all communication with his home for some time was cut off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span></p>

<p>On the 31st of July the Prussians under General von Göben entered
Darmstadt. Prince Louis’ parents, who were the only relations remaining
in Darmstadt, were daily with the Princess. On the 8th of August, whilst
on her way home from visiting her parents-in-law, the Princess
unexpectedly met the Prince in the street. He had obtained leave of
absence during a short armistice. The joy of this meeting can easily be
pictured! The Prince and Princess together visited the wounded; and on
the 10th of August the Prince was appointed by the Grand Duke to the
command of the Hessian division then in the field. By the Grand Duke’s
wish the Prince went for two days to Berlin, and then joined the troops
in Rhenish Hesse. He took up his quarters in the “<i>Gelbe Haus</i>” at
Nierstein-Oppenheim, and the Princess courageously shared them with
him&mdash;in spite of the cholera then raging there. On the 12th of
September&mdash;Prince Louis’ birthday&mdash;the little Princess was christened at
Darmstadt by the military chaplain; she received the names Irène (Peace)
Louise Marie Anna. The same day peace was ratified at Berlin&mdash;that peace
for which the brave mother of the child had so ardently longed.</p>

<p>The Cavalry Brigade which the Prince had commanded stood sponsor to the
child.</p>

<p>It was only on the 20th of September that the Prince and Princess with
the Hessian division made their public entry into Darmstadt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>I am at the head of a committee of ladies out of the different
classes of society to make a large bazaar, in which all the country
is to take part, for the Idiot Asylum. It is very difficult&mdash;all
the more as I have never had any thing to do with such things in my
life. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I wanted for the first public thing I undertake, to
take in all principles, and my mother-in-law has given her name to
it. I have chosen the committee out of different sets&mdash;half
<i>adelig</i> [people of rank] half <i>bürgerlich</i> [of the citizen class],
and all these ladies, half of whom I did not know before, come and
sit in my small room and discuss&mdash;and, as yet, do not disagree.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The people here are so much pleased that my Louis takes such
active part in all his duties&mdash;military and civil, for he attends
the different offices, and as General, I hear, he keeps great order
where there was until now disorder and great abuse of power. Of
course, I see him much less, and some days scarcely at all.</p>

<p>On the 14th we go to Gotha for about a fortnight, without the
children.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Gotha</span>, January 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>Dear Uncle and Aunt are well, and we are very happy here, for they
are always kindness itself to us. Uncle looks very well, but he
grows very stout, I think. We saw the <i>Braut von Messina</i>
[Schiller’s] so well given two nights ago. I thought so much of
dear Papa, who admired it greatly; and Uncle Ernest told me he had
it given for you, when you first came here.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Gotha</span>, January 22d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Two nights ago Uncle, Louis, and I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span> with a very clever old
actress, read a piece together. Louis resisted at first, but it
went very well. You can’t imagine how mild it is. I have the
windows always open. Gustav Freitag is here. I am always glad to
see him. He is a good friend to Uncle, and he is so honest and
straightforward.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Gotha</span>, January 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>I shall be very sorry to go away from here&mdash;the whole atmosphere
does one good. Dear Uncle is so amusing; he speaks of interesting
things, and has interesting people.</p>

<p>Our Quaker acquaintances have sent me a great deal for the bazaar,
and an old gentleman who heard of it, 100<i>l.</i>! I could not believe
my eyes. They are always so generous: and, hearing of my
undertaking a work of this sort, they sent me this spontaneously.
Is it not kind?</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, February 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>It is spring weather here altogether&mdash;quite warm when one comes out
of the house. It is so unnatural. The children enjoy it, and are
out a great deal, looking so well and strong: I wish you could see
them. The little one is growing up to her sister very fast, and
actually wears the frocks Victoria wore last year. I wish you could
hear all the extraordinary things Victoria says. Ella is civil to
all strangers&mdash;excepting to my mother-in-law, or to old ladies. It
is too tiresome. There is a large ball given by the officers at
their Casino to-night, to which we must go. It will be crowded and
hot. Our house gets on tolerably. The housekeeper, a Berlinerinn,
comes on the 20th, and we told that we can go into the house next
month. I can’t help doubting it, and I regret leaving this nice
little<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span> house, where our first happy years have been spent. I am so
glad that you have at least been in the new house, so that I can
always think that you are no stranger to it, which makes me like it
much better.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
February 10th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am happy to think you are quiet at Osborne after all you
had to go through. The emotion and all other feelings recalled by
such an event must have been very powerful and have tried you
much.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> It was noble of you, my darling Mama, and the great
effort will bring compensation. Think of the pride and pleasure it
would have given darling Papa&mdash;the brave example to others not to
shrink from their duty; and it has shown that you felt the intense
sympathy which the English people evinced, and still evince, in
your great misfortune.</p>

<p>How to-day recalls those bright and happy former years! There is no
cloud without a silver lining, and the lining to the black cloud
which overshadows your existence is the bright recollection of the
past blending into the bright hope of a happy future; a small part
of it also is the intense love of your children and nation, which
casts a light around you which many live to enjoy and admire, and
which few&mdash;if any&mdash;possess like you. I wish I could have sent a
fine nosegay of orange blossoms for to-day, but they could not have
arrived fresh so I gave it up.</p>

<p>Louis sends his tenderest love, and wishes me to say how much his
thoughts with mine are to-day constantly with you. He is very
industrious, and has a great deal to do now, and, I hear, does all
very well.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, February 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>How dear of you to have written to me on the 10th&mdash;a day of such
recollections! That last happy wedding-day at Buckingham Palace,
how well I remember it, and all the previous ones at Windsor, when
we all stood before your door, waiting for you and dear Papa to
come out. You both looked so young, bright, and handsome. As I grew
older, it made me so proud to have two such dear parents! And that
my children should never know you both together&mdash;that will remain a
sorrow to me as long as I live.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, March 10th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Your idea of Friedrichroda for us was so good, but alas! now
even that will be impracticable, on account of money. Louis has had
to take up money again at Coutt’s to pay for the house, and the
house is surety.</p>

<p>We must live so economically&mdash;not going <i>anywhere</i>, or seeing many
people, so as to be able to spare as much a year as we can. England
cost us a great deal, as the visit was short last time. We have
sold four carriage horses, and have only six to drive with now, two
of which the ladies constantly want for theatre, visits, etc.; so
we are rather badly off in some things. But I should not bore you
with our troubles, which are easy to bear.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>How trying the visit to Aldershot must have been, but it is so wise
and kind of you to go. I cannot think of it without tears in my
eyes. Formerly that was one of the greatest pleasures of my
girlhood, and you and darling Papa looked so handsome together. I
so enjoyed following you on those occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span>sions. Such moments I should
like to call back for an instant.</p>

<p>Our house here is quite empty, and the <i>déménagement</i> creates such
work. To-morrow night we sleep for the first time in the new house.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>I write from our dear little old house. May dear Papa’s and your
blessing rest on our new home, as I am sure it will! It is full of
souvenirs of you both&mdash;all your pictures, photographs of dear
brothers and sisters and home. It reminds me a little of Osborne,
of Buckingham Palace, a little even of Balmoral. Could I but show
it to darling Papa! If I have any taste, I owe it all to him, and I
learned so much by seeing him arrange pictures, rooms, etc.</p>

<p>At half-past seven we go into our house to-night. Bender is to say
a prayer and pronounce a blessing, when we with all our household
are assembled in hall; only Louis’ parents and William besides
ourselves. Yours and dear Papa’s I pray to rest on us.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>That [the death of the Duchess of Kent] was the commencement of all
the grief; but with darling Papa, so full of tenderness, sympathy
and delicate feeling for you, how comparatively easy to bear,
compared to all that followed!</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We are very comfortably established here, and I can’t fancy
that I am in Germany, the house and all its arrangements being so
English. When can we hope once to have you here? Of course <i>that</i>
is the summit of our wishes. Your rooms are on the east side and
very cool&mdash;as you always go abroad when it is hot, and suffer so
much<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span> from the heat. I shall die of it this year, as my rooms are
to the west.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Our grand-uncle of Homburg has just died, so that Homburg
falls to Uncle Louis now. But all the things of the Landgravine
Elizabeth go to Princess Reuss, and her [Aunt Elizabeth’s<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>]
rooms are full of beautiful miniatures, oil-paintings, and
ornaments <i>en masse</i>, like Gloucester House.</p>

<p>I shall be so glad to see dear Affie. His rooms are to be ready by
this evening. The house is very comfortable, but the weather is
awful&mdash;wind, rain, and sleet. In spite of it the house is so
cheerful.</p>

<p>How sorry I am for you that dear Aunt<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> is gone. As she was so
well this time, it will be a reason more for her returning soon to
you.</p>

<p>Dear Lady Frances Baillie was with me on Thursday, so dear and
charming.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We are living in such a state of anxiety and alarm. War<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
would be too fearful a thing to contemplate&mdash;brother against
brother, friend against friend, as it will be in this case! May the
Almighty avert so fearful a calamity! Here, at Mayence and
Frankfort, it will begin, if any thing happens, as there are mixed
garrisons; and we must side with one against the other. For Henry,
who is still here, it is dreadful. He can’t desert at such a
moment, and yet if he should have to draw his sword against his
country, his brothers fighting on the other side! Fancy the
complications and horrors of such a war!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span></p>

<p>For Vicky and Fritz it is really dreadful; please let me hear by
messenger what you hear from them. I am sure you think of us in
these troubled times. What would dear Papa have said to all this? I
long to hear from you, to know that your warm heart is acting for
Germany.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The dear old Oueen Marie Amélie<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> is gone to her rest at
last, after a long and so stormy a life! Claremont is now also
altered. How sad those constant changes are! It reminds one again
and again that we are on a journey, and that the <i>real home</i> is
elsewhere. All those who work hard and love their fellow-creatures
meet again, and the thorny path will be forgotten which leads to
the happy meeting. I sincerely mourn for the dear Queen, and she
was so kind to me always. I am glad she was one of Victoria’s
god-mothers.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Our Bazaar goes off wonderfully: 7,000 florins the first day,
and to-day again a great deal. Affie was invaluable in arranging,
selling, and assisting in every way. There have been crowds these
two days, as in England: something quite unusual for the quiet
inhabitants of this place. They have shown so much zeal and
devotion that I am quite touched by it, as I am more or less a
stranger to them.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>Thousand thanks for your dear lines, and for the money and charming
bas-relief of you, which I think very good. I thought so much of
former birthdays at home in Buckingham Palace. They were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span> happy.
We did nothing in particular; merely dined at Kranichstein with
Uncle Louis in the afternoon. It was warm and fine.</p>

<p>The money will go at once to Louis’ man of business toward paying
off the furniture, and is, indeed, very, very acceptable, more so
under present circumstances than any thing else you could give us;
and that part of the furniture will then all be your present.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 3d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The prospect of war seems to be nearing realization. It will
be so dreadful if it does. God be with us, if such a misfortune
befall poor Germany! These prospects have already done much harm to
trade. The large manufacturies send away their superfluous workmen,
and they sell next to nothing. Most unpopular amongst high and low,
and amongst people of all opinions, this civil war will be. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I have made all the summer out-walking dresses, seven in number,
with paletôts for the girls&mdash;not embroidered, but entirely made
from beginning to end; likewise the new necessary flannel shawls
for the expected. I manage all the nursery accounts, and every
thing myself, which gives me plenty to do, as every thing
increases, and, on account of the house, we must live <i>very</i>
economically for these next years.</p>

<p>It is so kind of you to give Dr. Priestley his fee, otherwise I
would have had scruples in giving so large a sum for my own
comfort.</p>

<p>If there is a war then, and Louis is away, what shall I do? This is
my constant dread and apprehension. As long as he comes home safe
again&mdash;that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span>is all I shall think of. Please God to spare me that
fearful anxiety, which weighs on me now already; for he, having
only a brigade, could not keep out of danger, like Fritz in
Schleswig.</p>

<p>I put my trust wholly in the Almighty, who has watched over and
blessed our life so richly thus far&mdash;so <i>much, much</i> more than I
ever deserved, or can deserve; and He will not forsake us in the
hour of need, I am sure.</p>

<p>These dangerous times make one very serious and anxious; the
comfort of faith and trust in God, who does all well and for the
best, is the only support. Life is but a pilgrimage&mdash;a little more
or a little less sorrow falls to one’s lot; but the anticipation of
evil is almost as great a suffering as the evil itself, and mine
always was an anxious nature, so I cannot banish the thoughts which
all the dreadful chances of war force upon one.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am so sorry for poor Louise and Beatrice, and
whooping-cough is a nasty thing, though I wish we could complain of
that as our sufferings here. Anxiety, worry without end!</p>

<p>Uncle Alexander returned from Vienna two days ago. The Emperor,
Uncle Alexander Mensdorff, all frantic at being forced into war,
but fearing now no more being able to prevent it. Cannot the other
three Powers interfere and step between at this dangerous
crisis&mdash;proposing a Congress, or any thing, so as to avert this
calamity?</p>

<p>Henry, who was here on six weeks’ leave, as he and Uncle Louis were
to have gone to Russia (which now, of course, they won’t do), had
suddenly to return to Bonn, as his regiment is made <i>mobil</i>. Uncle
Alexander receives the command of the 8th Armee-corps, which I
suppose and hope will be stationed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span> somewhere near here, as Louis
is in that, and <i>is to go</i>. He means to go to Berlin this afternoon
for a day to see Fritz, and tell him how circumstances now force
him to draw his sword against the Prussians in the service of his
own country. The whole thing is dreadful, and the prospect of being
left alone here at such a moment (for all our people, nearly, will
accompany Louis) is dreadful! If I were only over my troubles I
should not be so anxious, so nervous and unhappy, as I must say the
anticipation of all these dreadful things makes me. Could I follow
in the distance! But now that is impossible, and I have not a
single older married person near me. When dear Louis goes, of
course Westerweller goes too. I still pray and hope that there be
no war; even if all the troops are assembled, I hope that the other
Powers will interfere, and not look on whilst these brothers cut
each others throats. It is such an unnatural, monstrous war!</p>

<p>The death of Lord and Lady Rivers is dreadful for their children,
but how blessed for themselves! I hope Lady Caroline [Barrington]
will pass by here, which will be a great pleasure to me, though she
says she can but stop two days, as you wish her to be home by the
15th.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 18th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How glad I am to hear that Lord Clarendon is still hopeful!
Here as yet, though there is no distinct reason for it, save the
repugnance of all to this civil war, all still hope to avoid the
war. Every day we have occasion to hear how the Prussians detest
this war&mdash;army and all&mdash;and there are constant rows, with the
Landwehr in particular. Men of forty, who have families and homes
to look after, are taken away with their sons; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span> those who have
horses are also taken, with their horses: so that the wife and
children sit at home, unable to do any thing for their land. It is
ruining numbers, and murmurs get louder and louder. A revolution
must break out if this continues. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I do pray <i>most fervently</i>
that the King will listen to the just advice, in no way derogatory
to his dignity, of placing the hated question of the Duchies before
the Confederation; but I fear he won’t. If he would only listen to
that advice and disarm, all Germany would do it at once&mdash;only too
gladly&mdash;forgetting all the losses in the happiness of peace
restored. Forgive my stupid letter, but we live really so in the
midst of these affairs, on which our existence will turn, that I
can think of nothing else.</p>

<p>Austria can’t hold out much longer, and the country is getting very
violent against the King and Bismarck. The Emperor is less able to
concede and keep peace.</p>

<p>Now good-bye, dearest Mama. We are so grateful to you for taking
the children, if any thing comes to pass.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 22d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Any thing you hear of Vicky and Fritz, will you write it to
me? *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The cloud grows blacker every day, and the anxiety we all
live in is very great. But I ought not to write to you to-day of
such gloomy things, which, thank God, you only see and hear of from
the other side of the water.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The Duke and Duchess of Nassau were here yesterday. They,
like me, are in such an unpleasant position, should it come to
blows, which I still hope may be averted&mdash;for why should we
harmless mortals be attacked?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We shall be beggars very soon, if all goes on as it promises
to do; it is quite dreadful, and the want of other people (and
dissatisfaction) increases. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have ordered a good
travelling-bag for Louis, for much the same reason that some people
take out an umbrella in fine weather to keep off the rain, and this
is to be against a war. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have a sort of <i>Ahnung</i>
[presentiment] that it won’t come to the worst&mdash;for us at
least&mdash;and here we shall keep so quiet, only on the defensive, if
attacked.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 28th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;There seems a little chance of the dreadful prospects being
bettered. How I do pray it may be the commencement of a better
time; and that, if peace be established, it may be so <i>firmly</i>, so
that one may not live in the daily dread of new quarrels re-opening
between the two countries. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The man who built our house has nearly been made bankrupt, and
wants money from us to save him from ruin, and we can scarcely
manage it. The ruin this preparation for war, and consequent
cessation of all speculations, buildings, or trade, has brought on
people is dreadful, and of course increases.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How precious are your words of love and sympathy and the hope
you still hold to, that war may somehow be averted! It does me good
to hear it; and I know how much, and how lovingly, your thoughts
dwell with dear Vicky and with me during this time of trial. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I fear if the Bund orders the mobiliza<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span>tion, and goes against
Prussia, our troops will be the first to go, and then Louis may get
orders to be off any day. It is too dreadful! I live in such dread
that he may have to go just before, or at the very moment of my
confinement. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I hope Scotland will do you good. Please God, when you return
matters may be better. If Austria and Prussia would only fight out
their quarrel together; but the latter has taken refuge with the
Bund now, because she wanted it.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, June 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The serious illness of poor little Sigismund<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> in the midst
of all these troubles is really dreadful for poor Vicky and Fritz,
and they are so fond of that merry little child.</p>

<p>We have just received the news that the Prussians have crossed our
frontier and established themselves at Giessen. The excitement here
is dreadful and it is very difficult to keep people back from doing
stupid things&mdash;wanting to attack, and so on, which with our force
alone would be madness.</p>

<p>Louis&mdash;as always&mdash;remains quiet; but we live in a perpetual fever,
alarms being sent, being <i>gehetzt</i> [stirred up] from Vienna, as
they want the Bund to go with them at once. It is a dreadful time.
I anticipate it will be the close of the existence of the little
countries. God stand by us! Without the civil list Uncle Louis and
the family are beggars, as all the private property belongs to the
country.</p>

<p>It is so kind of dear Lady Ely to offer to come. I shall be very
glad of it, for from one day to another I don’t know what Louis’
duties may be; and, when I am laid up, it is so pleasant to have
some one who can write to you.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 18th.<br />
</p>

<p>These lines I send by our children, whom you will so kindly take
charge of&mdash;alas, that the times should be such as to make this
necessary! In your dear hands they will be so safe; and if we can
give you a little pleasure in sending them, it would be a real
consolation in parting from them, which we both feel very much.</p>

<p>The state of excitement here is beyond description. Troops
arriving, being billeted about&mdash;all will be concentrated from here
to Frankfort. Two days ago the Bund telegraphed for Uncle Alexander
to come, as the Prussians were advancing; we, of course, were all
unprepared, and the confusion and fright were dreadful; but, thank
God, they retreated again, when they got wind that troops were
assembling.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The state of affairs is awful; perpetual frights and false
news arrive. The Prussians are coming from Wetzlar or Bingen; all
the bustle and alarm for necessary defence; it is really dreadful.
Louis’ chief has his staff at Frankfort. Louis’ cavalry brigade is
there likewise, so he has his adjutant, etc., there, and does his
work early in the morning at Frankfort, returning here in the
afternoon, which has been kindly allowed on account of me. I remain
here, of course, as near dear Louis as I can; and now that the
children are gone, I have only myself to look after. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have
not the least fear, but my anxiety about Louis will be very great,
as you can imagine. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Collections are already being made for
the hospitals in the field, and the necessary things to be got for
the soldiers. Illness and wounds will be dreadful in this heat.
Coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span> linen and rags are the things of which one can’t have
enough, and I am working, collecting shirts, sheets, etc.; and now
I come to ask, if you could send me some old linen for rags. In
your numerous households it is collected twice a year, and sent to
hospitals. Could I beg for some this time? It would be such a
blessing for the poor Germans; and here they are not so rich, and
that is a thing of which in every war there has been too little.
Lint I have ordered from England by wish of the doctors; and
bandages also they wished for. If you could, through Dr. Jenner,
procure me some of these things, I should be so grateful. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Four dozen shirts we are making in the house. Every contribution of
linen or of patterns of good cushions, or any good bed which in the
English hospitals has been found useful, we should be delighted to
have. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;For the moment the people beg most for <i>rags</i>; our
house being new, we have none. I am tolerably well, and cannot be
too thankful for good nerves. Louis is very low at times, nervous
at leaving me; and for him I keep up, though at times not without a
struggle. May the Almighty watch over us, and not separate us, is
my hourly prayer!</p>

<p>In your hands we feel the children so safe, though we miss them
much. It is so kind of you to have taken them, and they are strong
and healthy. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>Two words by Lady Ely’s courier. I am so glad she is here. She
performed the journey in a day and night without difficulty; and
Christa, who merely came from Cassel, took three days coming by
road.</p>

<p>Alas! to-morrow Louis’ division moves on into<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span> the country to make
room for other troops, and he must go. It will be too far for him
to return&mdash;save with special permission for a few hours&mdash;so we
shall have to part. My courage is beginning to fail me, but I bear
up as best I can. God knows what a bitter trial it is! He is just
in front, so the first exposed. William is to go in Uncle Alex.’s
staff, and my poor mama-in-law is beginning to break down now. We
try to cheer each other. The whole thing is so hard: against her
countrymen&mdash;there where Louis has served. The whole thing is so
<i>contrecœur</i>, and the Prussian soldiers dislike it as much as we
do.</p>

<p>I am going to Frankfort with ever so many poor wives to take leave
of their husbands, who march to-day.</p>

<p>The heat is awful. I have no time to think of myself, or I daresay
I should have heat, etc., to complain of. Being still off and on
with Louis, and having things to do, keeps me up; but when he is
gone, and I have no man here to reassure me, it will be dreadful.</p>

<p>I must close. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Letters from home <i>now</i> are such a pleasure; do
let any one write to me sometimes to give me news of you all. Your
own child,</p>

<p class="r">

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The parting <i>now</i> was <i>so</i> hard! and he feels it so
dreadfully. I can scarcely manage to write. The heat, besides, is
overpowering. Our dear wedding-day four years ago! Four years of
undisturbed, real, and increasing happiness. How I thank and bless
the Almighty for them, and how fervently I pray that we may live
over this most bitter trial!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Whether Henry is engaged or not we don’t know, and can get no
news of him. At any rate he is cut off from news of us and the rest
of Germany; and, as our army is moving, and he is on the extreme
wing, at any moment he may find himself opposite to his own
brothers and countrymen. It is most painful, and has been to my
poor father-in-law a great shock, as we all hoped he had got away.
Please let my brothers know this. They will feel for this
unheard-of position for three brothers to be in. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Dear Lady Ely is a comfort and support to me, and it was quite a
relief to Louis to leave her with me. We are both so grateful that
she came. Christa is quite out of sorts about her country, and sees
every thing black. Marie is low about her brother; and we are so in
the middle of it all, that an English person who has no one
concerned in it all is really a relief.</p>

<p>I am so glad that you are pleased with the little ones. You be
sure, I know, not to let them get in the way of infection, if there
is still any.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Poor Vicky! She bears her trial [the death of her son, Prince
Sigismund] bravely, and it is a heavy one indeed. This dreadful war
is enough to break one’s heart. Those lives sacrificed for
nothing&mdash;and what will be the end of it all? All our troops are
gone now, too, and, what is so unpleasant, of course we here don’t
know where they go to&mdash;where they are. Letters are fetched by the
Feldpost, and as they are chiefly not near the railroads&mdash;at least
not Louis&mdash;we cannot telegraph. At such a moment I know dear Louis
fidgets dreadfully for news, and I not less. Since he has gone I
have heard nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<p>At length letters from Henry have come. He never received until the
29th the telegram his parents begged the King to send him on the
18th, for the King said he did not know where he was&mdash;thought he
was in Russia! He has been in all the engagements, wondering why,
as was originally arranged, no order came for him to leave.</p>

<p>I am so very uncomfortable, and it wants courage and patience and
hope, under such circumstances, to bear all. Of course, anxiety
about beloved Louis is the chief thing, and longing for news. The
Prussians are collecting a large army near Thüringen, in which
direction ours are marching. Probably Uncle Ernest against ours! He
might so well have remained quiet, and sent his troops to Mayence,
as was settled.</p>

<p>For dear Lenchen’s wedding-day receive every warm and affectionate
wish. May God’s blessing rest on their union! I am so glad you are
pleased with the dear children. I have already found that likeness
in Ella to Affie’s picture by Thorburn, but she is so like dear
Louis.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;There seems a chance of an armistice. I trust it is so, and
that peace will ensue. The enormous bloodshed on both sides this
fortnight is too awful to think of. Poor Austria! it is hard for
her. But as she is said to be ready to cede Venice, then, at least,
the Italian war will be at an end.</p>

<p>Surely the neutral Powers will try and prevent Austria and Prussia
beginning again; it is too horrid!</p>

<p>The rest of Germany now must knock under; but that is better than
again shedding so much blood on the chance of getting the upper
hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span></p>

<p>I have had some lines from dear Louis from the north of Hesse. He
is well; how I do hope now that they won’t come to blows.</p>

<p>How kind of you to give the children frocks for the wedding! Will
you kiss the dear little ones from me? I miss them very much.</p></div>

<p>[In a letter dated July 11, 1866, Prince Louis announces to the Queen
the birth of a strong, healthy girl, with “dark eyes and brown hair.”]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, July 19th.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Mama</span>:&mdash;<i>What</i> a time I have passed during these eight days
since baby’s birth! Firstly, I have to thank the Almighty for
having preserved my own sweet and adored husband, and for the
blessing of having had him by me, so dear, so precious, during my
confinement. After three days he had to go, and when he got near
Aschaffenburg found fighting going on. We could hear the guns here.
The Prussians shot from the roofs of the houses; they fought in the
streets; it must have been horrid. Our troops retreated (as had
always been intended) in perfect order. The wounded were brought in
here the following day. The 13th and 14th they fought. Louis was
there on the 14th; since then I have not seen him&mdash;God knows when I
shall again.</p>

<p>The Prussians have taken Frankfort, and they are at home here. No
communications allowed; get no papers or letters; may send none! An
existence of monstrous anxiety and worry, which it is impossible
for those to imagine who have not lived through it.</p>

<p>I had a letter from Louis from the Odenwald this morning, written
yesterday. They expected to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">{146}</a></span> Amorbach to-day. They are trying
to meet the Bavarians, who are never to be found.</p>

<p>I long for a letter from you. We have none at all. I have had none
from you since baby’s birth. The people, who are such cowards and
so silly, fly from here in all available droschkies.</p>

<p><i>How</i> I pray some end may soon come to this horrid bloodshed! Ah!
the misery around us you can’t imagine. Henry has never received
his discharge, and has gone unscathed, in spite of being so exposed
through all these battles.</p>

<p>I myself am very well, and I don’t give way, though the anxiety
about Louis leaves me no peace.</p>

<p>Baby is well and very pretty. The time she came at prevented a
thought of disappointment at her being a girl. Only gratitude to
the Almighty filled our hearts, that I and the child were well, and
that dear Louis and I were together at the time. The times are
hard; it wants all a Christian’s courage and patience to carry one
through them; but there is <i>one Friend</i> who in the time of need
does not forsake one, and He is my comfort and support. God bless
you, my own Mama, and pray for your child,</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Alice</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
Friday, July 27th, 9 o’clock <small>P.M.</small><br />
</p>

<p>At this moment the messenger has arrived, to leave again at five
to-morrow morning. A thousand thanks for your dear letter, the
first I have received since baby’s birth!</p>

<p>To-night (since Sunday no news of Louis) at length I have heard
that dear Louis is well. These last four days they have been
fighting again. I had a few lines from him. These last two nights
he slept in a field, and the country is so poor, that they had
nothing but a little bread during two days<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span> to eat. Now the
Prussians, having made peace with Austria, and having refused it to
us, are advancing on our troops from three sides.</p>

<p>I can scarcely write; this anxiety is killing me, and my love has
been so exposed! All are in admiration of his personal bravery and
tender attention to the suffering and want of all around. He never
thinks of himself, and shares all the dangers and privations with
the others.</p>

<p>Louis says they long for peace. He disapproves the different
Governments for not now giving way to Prussia, and begs me to use
my influence with Uncle Louis to accept Prussian conditions to
spare further bloodshed.</p>

<p>From all parts of the country the people beg me to do what I can.</p>

<p>The confusion here is awful, the want of money alarming; right and
left one must help. As the Prussians pillaged here, I have many
people’s things hidden in the house. Even whilst in bed I had to
see gentlemen in my room, as there were things to be done and asked
which had to come straight to me. Then our poor wounded&mdash;the wives
and mothers begging I should inquire for their husbands and
children. It is a state of affairs too dreadful to describe.</p>

<p>The new anxiety to-night of knowing a dreadful battle is expected,
perhaps going on, in which dear Louis again must be! I can scarcely
bear up any longer; I feel it is getting too much. God Almighty
stand by us! My courage is beginning to sink. I see no light
anywhere; and my own beloved husband still in danger, and we cannot
hear, for the Prussians are between us and them. Any thing may have
happened to him, and I can’t hear it or know it! I could not go to
him were he wounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">{148}</a></span></p>

<p>What I have suffered and do suffer no words can describe&mdash;the
sleepless nights of anxiety, the long days without news&mdash;<i>how</i> I
pray it may soon end, and dear darling Louis be spared me!</p>

<p>In these days I have so longed to hear from you. It would have been
such a comfort, and I longed for it much.</p>

<p>If we live, and peace is restored, the country and every thing will
be in such a mess, and both of us in such want of change, that we
must go somewhere; but we shall then, I fear, be next to ruined.
You can’t think what war in one’s own country&mdash;in a little one like
this&mdash;is! The want is fearful. I must go to bed, as it is late. I
am well, so is the little one; but I can’t sleep or eat well all
along; and the worry of mind and much to do keep me weak.</p>

<p>Oh, that we were together again! Good-bye beloved Mama. These next
days I fear will be dreadful. May the Almighty watch over dear
Louis! You will pray for him, won’t you?</p>

<p><i>P.S.</i>&mdash;The standard of Louis’ cavalry regiment, which they did not
take with them, and which is usually kept at the Schloss, is in my
room for safety.</p>

<p>Forgive the shocking writing, but I am so upset to-night, since my
messenger of Tuesday returned with Louis’ letter.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, August 4th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The linen, etc., for the wounded has arrived, and been so
useful; a thousand thanks for it! Matters here change from one day
to another, and I hope Louis may soon be able to return with the
troops. Uncle Louis I do hope and pray will then return, and I hope
he will regain the favor which he had lost, for any change now
would be dreadful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">{149}</a></span></p>

<p>My father-in-law is really in such a state since these events, and
his nerves so shattered, that my mother-in-law trembles for him,
and tries to keep him out of all. He is so angry, so heartbroken at
the loss of Oberhessen, which is probable, that he wishes not to
outlive it. My poor mama-in-law burst into tears this morning in my
room, where this scene took place.</p>

<p>I have just returned from having been to inquire after the wounded
at the different hospitals and houses, which are filling fast as
they can be brought from Aschaffenburg, Laufach, etc. As soon as I
am better, I will go to them myself; but the close and crowded
wards turn one easily faint.</p>

<p>Becker saw Louis three days ago, and accompanied him to Munich for
a day. I hear he is well, though for six nights he had slept out of
doors, and the last three nights it had poured incessantly; and all
that time&mdash;on account of ours not having a truce, and expecting to
be attacked&mdash;they were, being such a mass together, without
provisions, barely a morsel of bread. I am so distressed about poor
Anton Hohenzollern and Obernitz; so many acquaintances and friends
have fallen on both sides, it is dreadful!</p>

<p>The town is full of Prussians. I hope they will not remain too
long, for they pay for nothing, and the poor inhabitants suffer so
much. There is cholera in the Prussian army, and one soldier lies
here ill of it. I hope it won’t spread.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is fearful. Those who have seen the misery war brings with
it, near by&mdash;the sufferings, the horror&mdash;know well what a scourge
it is. May the Almighty spare our poor Germany this new evil! I
forgot to thank you in Louis’ name, as he had told me, for your
letter, which he found here on his re<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span>turn. He is to-day still at
Berlin, and we are so grateful for your having written to good
Fritz. What he can do I know he will.</p>

<p>Uncle Louis is still at Munich, and I don’t think he will abdicate;
besides, he is at this moment doing what his country wishes.</p>

<p>I received a letter from Julie Battenberg, saying what Uncle
Alexander had written to her about Louis: “<i>Le Prince Alexandre
m’écrit qu’il a obtenu du Grand Duc la démission de Perglas</i>” (who
commanded the troops so badly), “<i>et la nomination du Prince Louis
en commandement de nos troupes; il me dit à cette occasion que
votre Mari pendant cette triste campagne s’est fait aimer et
apprécier de tout le monde qu’il s’est fait une excellente
réputation, et qu’il sera reçu à bras ouverts par la troupe</i>.” * *
* It is a large command for one so young, and with so little
experience&mdash;all the more so, as we don’t know how long peace may
last. He is sent to Berlin, as the country all look to Louis to
prevent new evil; and all this without poor Louis having any direct
position of heir to be able to enforce his opinion. He has no easy
life of it.</p>

<p>The horse you gave Louis he rode in the different engagements, and
praised him very much. He stood the fire quite well, but not the
bursting of the shells close by.</p>

<p>About the children, the 23d is quite soon enough for their
departure.</p>

<p>We shall not call baby “Irène,” unless all seems really peaceful,
and at this moment it does not look promising. I am very sad and
dismayed at the whole lookout. My mother-in-law was so pleased with
your letter, and thanks you warmly for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Nierstein</span>, <span class="smcap">Gelbes Haus</span>, August 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>This dear day makes me think so much of you, of home, and of those
two dear ones whose memories are so precious, and who live on with
us, and make me often think that we had parted only yesterday.</p>

<p>We are so pleased at your saying that you claim Louis as <i>your</i>
son. He always considers <i>himself</i> in particular your child, and if
any thing helps to stimulate him in doing his duty well, it is the
sincere wish of being worthy to claim and deserve that title.
Darling Papa would be proud of him, and pleased to see how
earnestly he takes his duties, and how conscientiously and
unselfishly he fulfils them, for he has had and still has many
trials&mdash;things I can tell you of when we meet again.</p>

<p>Life is such a pilgrimage, and so uncertain is its duration that
all minor troubles are forgotten and easily borne, when one thinks
what one must live for.</p>

<p>Before leaving Darmstadt yesterday to come here, we went to see
some of the wounded again. One poor man had died since I was last
there: he had been so patient, and had suffered so much. Another
had had an operation performed and was very low&mdash;he was crying like
a child. I could scarcely comfort him, he held my hand and always
moaned out “<i>Es brennt so</i>” [It burns so]. Such nice people most of
those young men are&mdash;very young, and for that class so well
educated. All who are well enough are reading.</p>

<p>I must praise the ventilation and cleanliness in the different
hospitals; in these things they have made wonderful progress here.</p>

<p>We are here in Rheinhessen, as Louis has to take his command. This
place, Nierstein, lies between<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span> Worms and Mayence, and all our
troops are quartered about here. Louis’ staff is at Worms, where he
himself is to-day, and was already last night.</p>

<p>He was more hopeful about the prospects for Oberhessen on his
return from Berlin, and had been so kindly received by dear Vicky
and Fritz.</p>

<p>When Louis wrote his farewell to his cavalry brigade (who are so
sorry to lose him), as a remembrance that he and they had stood in
the field together for their first campaign, he asked these two
regiments, officers and men, to stand sponsors to baby, as she was
born during that time, and they are delighted, but wish the child
to have one of their names! We wait till the troops can come home
to christen baby on that account. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I don’t think we shall be
here very long. Whenever the Prussians leave Darmstadt we can
return.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Nierstein</span>, <span class="smcap">Gelbes Haus</span>, August 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We are here still, and all our troops, and Louis has a great
deal to do. To-morrow the armistice is over, and at present we have
no news as to its prolongation or the settlement of peace; but it
must be one or other. A little private war of Prussia against us
would be absurd and impossible, so the troops remain quartered in
the little villages about here. The country here is so rich and
fertile, the villages so clean, with such good houses; but the
people are blessed with children to an extraordinary extent! It is
the most richly populated part of all Germany, and there are more
people on the square mile than in England.</p>

<p>The change of air&mdash;though it is but two hours from Darmstadt&mdash;has
done me good, and if later, through your great kindness, a little
journey should be possible to us, it would be very beneficial to
both of us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span></p>

<p>This house is quite close to the Rhine, and this instant our
pioneers have come by from Worms on their pontoon bridge singing a
quartett, about twenty or thirty men. It looks so pretty, and they
sing so beautifully. On their marches the soldiers always sing, and
they have so many beautiful songs, such as: “Der gute Kamerad.” The
Germans are such <i>gemütklich</i> [simple, kindly, sociable] people.
The more one lives with them, the more one learns to appreciate
them. It is a fine nation. God grant this war, which has produced
so many heroes, and cost so many gallant lives, may not have been
in vain, and that at length Germany may become a mighty, powerful
Power! It will then be the first in the world, where the great
ideas and thoughts come from, free from narrow-minded prejudice,
and when once the Germans have attained political freedom, they
will be lastingly happy and united.</p>

<p>But the present state of things is sad, though one should not
despair of some good resulting from it.</p>

<p>My letter is quite confused. I beg a thousand pardons for it, but I
have been interrupted so often.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Gelbes Haus</span>, August 29th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The children arrived well and safe, and in such good looks.
It was a great pleasure to see them again; and I tried to make
Victoria tell me as much as possible of dear Grandma and uncles and
aunts, and when she is not absent-minded she is very communicative.
How much we thank you, darling Mama, for having kept them and been
so good to them I can’t tell you. This change has been so good for
them; for now there are both cholera and small-pox at Darmstadt,
which is still full of Prussian soldiers. More have come, and our
peace is not yet concluded. I hope it is no bad sign, and that the
hopes of losing less will not disappear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span></p>

<p>We were only in Darmstadt for the day when the children arrived,
and we go there for a few hours to-morrow on business. Louis has a
great deal to do, and all the military things are in his hands.</p>

<p>I am not feeling very well. The air here after a few days is
relaxing, and I begin to feel more what a strain there has been on
my nerves during this time. I have such a pain in my side again.
Mountain air Weber wants me to have, and quiet, away from all
bothers; but I fear that is impossible <i>now</i>, on account of Louis
not being able to leave&mdash;and then financially.</p>

<p>I have some <i>Heimweh</i> [home-sickness] after dear England, Balmoral,
and all at home, I own, though the joy of being near dear Louis
again is <i>so</i> great! But life is meant for work, and not for
pleasure, and I learn more and more to be grateful and content with
that which the Almighty sends me, and to find the sunshine in spite
of the clouds; for when one has one’s beloved, adored husband by
one’s side, what is there in the world that is too heavy to bear?
My own darling Mama, when I think of darling Papa and of you, and
that he is not <i>visible</i> at your side now, I long to clasp you to
my heart, in some way to cheer the loneliness which is a poor
widow’s lot. Oh, none in the world is harder than that!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, August 31st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Thank you for telling me how you spent that dear day; it must
have been peaceful and solemn, the beautiful country harmonizing
well with the thoughts of that great and beautiful soul which ever
lives on with us. He remains nearer and nearer to me, and the
recollection of many things dear Papa told me is a help and a stay
in my actions, particularly of late. The separation seems so short.
I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span> see him and hear him speak so plainly. Alas! my children
have never seen him. Through you, darling Mama, and in your rooms,
and at your side, they must learn to know him, that they may become
worthy of their descent.</p>

<p>Yesterday we saw the children. Victoria is not quite well, but Ella
is well, and won’t leave me when I come into the room; she keeps
kissing me and putting her fat arms round my neck. There is each
time a scene when I go away. She is so affectionate: so is dear
Victoria. I send you a photograph of our smallest, who is such a
pretty child, and very good.</p>

<p>The peace is not concluded yet; more Prussians have been quartered
in and around Darmstadt. The people are very angry at this lasting
so long *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;They believe it is <i>Strafeinquartierung</i> [done to
punish us]. Nothing is settled as to what we keep or lose, and we
know and hear nothing. Waiting here, uncomfortably lodged, the
troops impatient to go home, as they have nothing to do, gets very
irksome.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Gelbes Haus</span>, September 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;At last the peace is concluded, though not yet ratified. The
terms are not so bad. We lose the Hinterland and the Domains there,
as also the whole of Hesse-Homburg&mdash;in all sixty-four thousand
souls&mdash;pay three millions contribution, besides having kept a large
part of the Prussian army six weeks for nothing, which cost the
country twenty-five thousand florins daily. For Oberhessen we go
into the North-German Bund, and half the army is under Prussian
command, which will make a dreadful confusion. Louis would prefer
having it for the whole, particularly in anticipation, alas! of a
coming war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span></p>

<p>The railroads, posts, and telegraphs also become Prussian; and they
demand, besides, some fine old pictures, books, and manuscripts,
which had once belonged to the Kölner Dom, and were made a present
of to this country years ago; and for our Domains no
<i>Entschädigung</i> [compensation]. In exchange for Homburg we get some
small places&mdash;amongst others, Rumpenheim.</p>

<p>When the peace is ratified and the money paid, the Prussians leave
the country, which must now be very shortly. Until then Louis must
stop here, and as he can only get leave now and then to go to
Darmstadt, and that always uncertain, baby’s christening is still
impossible, as Louis must be there. She will be called “Irène
Louise Marie Anna.”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Gelbes Haus</span>, September 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Tired of constantly putting off and waiting, we settled
yesterday to have baby christened to-morrow, as it is Louis’
birthday, and to go for the day to Darmstadt. Though the Prussians
are still there, some of the godfathers are coming over; otherwise
it will be quite quiet.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How true and sad is what you say, dear Mama, about life and
its trials! Alas! that it should be you, dear, loving, kind Mama,
who have had to drink so deeply of that cup of bitterness. Those
who possess all they love, as I do, can, however, feel all the more
keenly, and sympathize more truly with you for what you have lost,
though it is a grief we do not know. How I do long always to
alleviate this grief for you, dearest Mama; but that is the world’s
trial. None can bear the burden for you. One must carry it one’s
self; and it wants patience and courage to bear such as yours, dear
Mama. I feel for you now more than ever since<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">{157}</a></span> during that month I
feared from day to day my happy life might be brought to a violent
close, and anticipated all the misery that <i>might</i> come, but which
the Almighty graciously averted.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;That you sent Louis, besides the pretty souvenir, the money
for something in the house is really so kind. Our whole dining-room
we consider your present, and it is furnished as like an English
one as possible.</p>

<p>The name Irene,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> through other associations, is one my
parents-in-law and we like; it stands, besides, as a sort of
recollection of the peace so longed for, and which I so gladly
welcomed. It will always reminds us of the time, and of how much we
have to be grateful for.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, September 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We are settled here again; our troops have returned and Uncle
Louis likewise. The former were received most warmly by the
inhabitants and showered with nosegays&mdash;Louis also, who rode at
their head. We saw them all in front of the Schloss, and it was sad
to see the thinned ranks and to miss the absent faces we knew so
well. On the 13th and 14th of July, at Frohnhofen, Laufach, and
Aschaffenburg, out of 8,000 we lost 800 men and 11 officers, and of
the officers just those who were very intimate with the Prussians,
and who wished Germany to be united under Prussia.</p>

<p>This afternoon we are going to see after the poor wounded, some of
whom are still very ill with such horrible wounds. So much
suffering and pain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span> grief to those poor people, who are
innocent in this unhappy war!</p>

<p>If only now the other sovereigns will forget their antipathies and
the wrongs they have suffered from Prussia, and think of the real
welfare of their people and the universal fatherland, and make
those sacrifices which will be necessary to prevent the recurrence
of these misfortunes!</p>

<p>The poor Homburgers marched by with our troops, and their tears and
ours fell as we saw them (who had fought so bravely under Uncle
Louis) for the last time before they become Prussians, and return
to their homes as such.</p>

<p>My parents-in-law are gone to Switzerland. Henry is become Colonel
of the 2d Guard of Uhlans at Berlin.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I can but write a few lines, as we are going with the
children to Uncle Alexander to Jugenheim for a few days. The change
of air is wanted for Ella, who is still pale; and Irene has never
had any change yet, and is also rather pale.</p>

<p>We were at Frohnhofen and Laufach a few days ago to see where the
unfortunate engagement was, and visited the graves of our soldiers.
In the middle of a field there is a mound, below which some eighty
men and some officers lie, and so on. It makes a very sad
impression, for as our troops retreated, and they were buried by
the people, none know which of the common soldiers or even which of
the officers lie in the different places. We found some balls, and
things the soldiers had thrown off during the fight. In one grave
in the churchyard, the wounded who died afterward are buried. I
asked who lay there, and the gravedigger answered “<i>Ein<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span> Preuss’
und ein Hess’ liegen dort beisammen</i>” [“A Prussian and a Hessian
lie there together”], united in death, and fallen by each other’s
hand, perhaps. Some of the officers who accompanied us, and had not
been there since the engagement, were much overcome on seeing the
graves of their comrades. I put wreaths and flowers on them, and
ordered crosses where we knew who lay there.</p>

<p>The wounded here are recovering, and I go often to see after them.</p>

<p>As you say, this large Prussia is by no means an united Germany;
but, nevertheless, I think the duty of the other German sovereigns,
in spite of all, is to unite with Prussia and place themselves
under her, so as to make her unite with Germany. Otherwise, the
next opportunity, they will be annexed.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Heiligenburg</span>, <i>Jugenheim</i>, October 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We return to town to-day, leaving the children for another
week, as the air on the hill is so delicious. Louis has so much to
do that he can’t remain away longer, though he went at half-past
seven every morning to his office, returning for luncheon.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 22d.<br />
</p>

<p>On Thursday we are going to Waldleiningen for a fortnight and take
Victoria with us. The two little girls knew your photograph at
once, and began, of course, to talk of you and of England.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Waldleiningen</span>, October 31st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is quite beautiful here. We found dear Ernest, Marie and
children well; the former so kind and dear, as they always are.
Victoria and Alberta get on tolerably together. The little boy is
splendid, so strong and fat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span></p>

<p>The Castle is so fine and lies just in the midst of mountains and
woods, and there are walks without end&mdash;many of them reminding me
so much of Scotland.</p>

<p>The Nichels came to see us, and Marie and I played with Nichel<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>;
it reminded me so much of the good old times to see him.</p>

<p>Ella’s birthday is to be kept when we return. She is too small to
know the difference of the day. I thank you beforehand for the
locket for her with dear Papa’s picture. The children always speak
of their two Grandpapas&mdash;dear Grandpapa in Heaven, and dear
Grandpapa in Darmstadt. Victoria, hearing Papa so often mentioned,
and seeing his pictures about everywhere, asks no end of questions
about him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, November 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>I am better, thank you, but I am so weak without the least reason,
and dreadfully chilly. Still, I go out regularly in all weathers
and take exercise, but of an evening I am quite knocked up.</p>

<p>We always breakfast at half past eight, as Louis gets up early and
prefers it; so that I lead a very healthy life, and in spite of
that am not well. A change quite into another climate, for a few
months was what I really required; but it was impossible. On that
account, dear Mama, I shall hope to have a full three months in
England when we come, and perhaps part of the time with Bertie, if
he can have us. I went through a great deal this summer during my
confinement. The excitement and the will to keep well kept me so at
the time, but I feel it now, alas! and show it, too, for I am
getting so thin again.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161" id="page_161">{161}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, November 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>Dear Vicky’s birthday. She will think how happily she passed it at
Windsor last year, and, though she has another child, it cannot
replace to her what the other one was.</p>

<p>How glad I am to hear you praise dear Alix! She is so good,
<i>tactvoll</i> [full of tact] and true. I love her very much.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of seeing dear Countess Blücher for a few hours
here last Sunday. She came during a dreadful snowstorm. The young
King of Bavaria is coming here for the day to-morrow. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The large pictures from Homburg&mdash;George III., Queen Charlotte,
George IV., William IV., and the Duke of York <i>en pied</i>&mdash;Uncle
Louis has given us, and now that I have given these good people,
whom I don’t like, the best places in our rooms, I should so much
like you and dear Papa, which you promised me some years ago from
the last Winterhalters, or from those in the garter dress.</p>

<p>I look forward so much to seeing dear Bertie here, if only for a
few hours. I suppose Monday or Sunday, if he travels day and night,
as he leaves on Friday; it is a very long and cold journey.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 22d.<br />
</p>

<p>A thousand thanks for the precious book,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and for your dear
lines. The former I have nearly finished. I got it yesterday
morning, and you can well imagine that every spare moment was
devoted to its study.</p>

<p>I think it very well done, and I am only sorry that General Grey
cannot continue it, as the other persons, I believe, did not know
dear Papa. The longer I live, the more I see and know of the world,
the deeper my tender admiration grows for such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span> father. It makes
me feel myself so small, so imperfect, when I think that I am his
child, and am still so unworthy of being it. How many people here
who like to hear of dear Papa, ask me about him, and you can
understand with what pride and love I talk of him, and tell them
things which make them all share our sorrow at not having him here
any more! But if ever a life has outlived a man, dear Papa’s has
done so. In my thoughts and aims he ever remains the centre and the
guiding star. Dear beloved Papa, he never half knew, how much, even
when a foolish child, I loved and adored him. His great life will
be a model for many and many for generations to come, and his great
thoughts and aims can leave none idle who knew them.</p>

<p>You kindly ask how I am. Better, thank you, since I have begun some
bark&mdash;quinine I can’t take, or else I should have been well sooner.</p>

<p>Victoria I am teaching to read&mdash;in playing with cards with
different letters on them.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 30th.<br />
</p>

<p>To-day it is six whole years since we were engaged to each other in
the Red Drawing-room at Windsor, when we in dear Papa’s little room
afterward received your and dear Papa’s sanction to it. And the
following year&mdash;how sad that already was, for darling Papa was
beginning to be unwell. How constantly do I think of you, beloved
Mama, during that fortnight of anxiety and sorrow! God mercifully
spare you to us, though for yourself it was the commencement of the
sad and lonely existence you lead without dear Papa.</p>

<p>I am sure it is good for little Henry<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> to be this<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">{163}</a></span> winter with
you in England: the Berlin climate is very unwholesome. Health is
such a blessing. If one has children, the first wish is they should
be healthy, for ill health influences all, and nothing more than
temper.</p>

<p>We intend, if possible, going for a day or two to Carlsruhe. Poor
Louise and Fritz went through so much that is painful this summer.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I read an immense deal now of serious, and what some call dry,
books; but it is a great resource to me, and the thought of
standing still, if one does not study, urges me on. The long winter
evenings we always spend together, and twice in the week receive in
the evening, when I play on the piano duets with such as play on
the violin, and pass the evenings very pleasantly.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Carlsruhe</span>, December 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>Thousand thanks for your dear letter! I congratulate you on all
having gone off so well at Wolverhampton,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and am very grateful
for the account. Dear Bertie’s visit is over, and it has been a
very great pleasure to us to have seen him again, and to have him
under our own roof&mdash;where we at length had an opportunity, in a
small way, to return his hospitality and constant kindness to us.
God bless him, dear brother! he is the one who has from my
childhood been so dear to me.</p>

<p>We have come here, and I think it has pleased good Fritz. Louis
seems very well. I saw Lady Fanny Baillie yesterday, looking dear
and pretty as ever. It is a pleasure to look at her sweet face.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Carlsruhe</span>, December 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>As every year during <i>these days</i> my thoughts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span> with you, and as
each year brings round again the anniversary of that dreadful
misfortune, it seems more and more impossible that five years
should already have elapsed, since he whom we all loved so tenderly
was taken from our sight. How I thank the Almighty again and again,
as this season returns, that He spared you to us, when at such a
moment, we trembled for your precious life, fearing that two so
united in life even in death could not be parted. What should we
poor children, what would the country have done, had that second
misfortune come over us! Yet it seemed selfish and unkind to wish
for your loving wife’s heart the solitary widow’s existence. How
bravely and nobly you have borne it!</p>

<p>We leave this to-morrow morning, and have spent pleasant days here.
There was much to talk about together, and Fritz is so excellent
and so wise, that I am always glad to hear him. Dear Louise is well
and in good looks, and most kind.</p>

<p>Now I must end beloved Mama. God bless you and comfort you, and in
these days let sometimes the thought of your absent child, who was
at your side during that dreadful time, mingle with the
recollection of the past!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 14th.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved, precious Mama</span>:&mdash;On awaking this morning, my first thoughts
were of you and of dear, darling Papa! Oh, how it reopens the
wounds scarcely healed, when this day of pain and anguish returns!
This season of the year the leafless trees, the cold light, every
thing reminds me of that time!</p>

<p>Thousand thanks for your dear letter received yesterday. <i>Well</i>,
only <i>too well</i>, do I remember every hour, almost every minute, of
those days, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_165" id="page_165">{165}</a></span> such an inexpressible longing to throw my
arms round your neck, and to let my tears flow with yours, while
kneeling at that beautiful grave.</p>

<p>The tender love and the deep sorrow caused by His loss remain ever
with me, and will accompany me through life. At the age I then was,
with its sensitive feelings, it made an impression which, I think,
nothing can efface&mdash;above all, the witnessing your grief. Happily
married as I am, and with such a good, excellent, and loving
husband, how far more can I understand <i>now</i> the depth of that
grief which tore your lives asunder! I played our dear Papa’s organ
under his beloved picture this morning, and my heart and my
thoughts were in dear England with you all.</p>

<p>We found our children well on our return, and Irène prospers
perfectly on her donkey’s milk.</p>

<p>My mother-in-law is so much pleased with the book,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and it has
interested her very much. She came to see me early this morning on
account of its being the 14th. She is always so kind and full of
attentions.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>How dear of you to have written to me on the 14th; thousand thanks
for your letter! How much I thought of <i>all</i> on that day you can
imagine; also what good it did me to know that you still thought of
me so kindly with those recollections. I am so sorry to hear that
you are so suffering. I hope Osborne will do you good, and that
rest and quiet will refresh you.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I hope by this time that you are quite recovered, though this
mild damp weather is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span> made to give one strength. I feel it so
much also, and am really only kept alive by steel, for off and on I
am so weak that I nearly faint if I have to stand any time, and
this is so unpleasant.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am trying to found what is no small undertaking: a
“<i>Frauen-Verein</i>” to be spread all over the land in different
committees, the central one being here under my direction, for the
purpose of assisting the International Convention for nursing and
supporting the troops in time of war, which was founded at Geneva,
and to which this country also belongs. The duty in time of peace
will be to have nurses brought up and educated for the task, who
can then assist in other hospitals or amongst the poor, or to nurse
the rich, wherever they may be required in time of war. This
committee of women has to collect all the necessary things for the
wounded and for the marching troops, has to see to their being sent
to right places, etc.</p>

<p>All these things were done by private people in this war, and,
though quantities of things were sent, the whole plan was not
organized, so that there was want and surplus at the same time.</p>

<p>In time of peace these things should be organized, so that, when
war comes, people know where to send their things to, and that no
volunteer nurses go out who have not first learnt their business.</p>

<p>The same thing exists in Baden, in Bavaria, and in Prussia, and
here it is much wanted. But all these undertakings are difficult,
particularly in the choice of persons to assist one. Still I hope I
shall be able to do it. My mother-in-law helps me, and I hope
before long to be able to begin.</p>

<p>The Elector is coming here on a visit to-day, and Uncle Alexander
returned from Petersburg last night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have a dreadful cold, and am not very well besides, so I
can but scribble a few lines. To-day we go to the <i>Bescheerung</i>
[distribution of Christmas gifts] to the wounded in three
hospitals. Of course it will be very hot.</p>

<p>Henry is here for a few days. He looks so handsome in his new
uniform with his dark beard. He has grown so good-looking these
last few years, and he is so excellent. I am very fond of him. He
is likewise so much gayer than formerly.</p>

<p>The good eatables you sent will be given to-night, when Louis’
parents and brothers come to us for dinner.</p>

<p>The children have a party for their tree.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 30th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;May the Almighty give you every blessing of peace and comfort
which the world can still give you, till you gain that greater
blessing and reward above all others, which is reserved for such as
my own sweet mother! May every blessing fall on my old dear home,
with all its dear ones! May peace, and the glory which peace and
order bring with it, with its many blessings, protect my native
land; and may, in the new year, your wise and glorious reign, so
overshadowed by dear Papa’s spirit, continue to prosper and be a
model and an ornament to the world!</p>

<p>This year of pain and anxiety, and yet for us so rich in blessings,
draws to a close. It moves me more than ever as its last day
approaches. For how much have we not to thank the Almighty&mdash;for my
life, which is so unworthy compared to many others, the new life of
this little one, and above all the preservation of my own dear
husband, who is my all in this life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">{168}</a></span></p>

<p>The trials of this year must have brought some good with all the
evil: good to the individual and good to the multitude. God grant
that we may all profit by what we have learnt, and gain more and
more that trust in God’s justice and love, which is our guide and
support in trouble and in joy! Oh, more than ever have I felt in
this year, that God’s goodness and love are indeed beyond
comprehension!</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am really glad to hear that you can listen to a little
music. Music is such a heavenly thing, and dear Papa loved it so
much, that I can’t but think that now it must be soothing, and
bring you near to him. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<h3><a name="yr-1867" id="yr-1867">1867</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> experiences of the late war had shown the necessity for an efficient
and widespread organization for aid to the sick and wounded on the
battlefield. Already in 1865 a society had been formed in Hesse, with
Prince and Princess Charles as its patrons, in accordance with the
resolutions passed at the Geneva Convention in 1863, and had done good
work in the last war. The nursing of the wounded had hitherto been
undertaken by “Deaconesses,” Sisters of Mercy, and orders of a kindred
nature.</p>

<p>After the close of the war, those at the head of the committee (or
Society) made themselves responsible, so far as lay in their power, for
the wounded and disabled, and for the families of those who had fallen
in the war. It was, however, felt to be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_169" id="page_169">{169}</a></span> desirable that other
committees should be formed throughout the country for the purpose of
training specially-qualified nurses.</p>

<p>The Princess was deeply interested in this question&mdash;indeed, her whole
attention had been directed to it since the beginning of the war, after
she had seen what was done in Baden under the direction of the Grand
Duchess. She had also before her the example of Florence Nightingale,
and the good she had done during and after the Crimean war. The Princess
was naturally fond of nursing, and of all that had to do with it, and
she therefore eagerly took up the idea of founding a Frauen-Verein, or
“Ladies’ Union”&mdash;an idea which, under her auspices, was soon most
successfully carried out.</p>

<p>She wished lay women and ladies of all classes to join in this
undertaking, so that the nursing should not be confined, as heretofore,
to religious orders only. After much consultation a committee was formed
in 1867, consisting of six ladies and four doctors, with the Princess as
President. The central committee of the “Ladies’ Union” was to be at
Darmstadt, under the Princess’ direction. The other committees spread
over the whole country. Its object was to assist “the nursing and
supporting of the troops in times of war,” and in times of peace to
“train nurses, to assist other hospitals, or amongst the poor, or to
nurse the rich”&mdash;in fact, to help wherever help was required. In 1868
the members belonging to the “Ladies’ Union” had greatly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span>creased, and
in 1869 they reached the number of 2,500.</p>

<p>The duties of the local committees consisted in collecting money and all
necessary materials for the wounded or for the troops on the march. The
central committee did its best in times of peace to direct the general
attention to this most important question by lectures on the subject,
delivered by medical men.</p>

<p>At the time the Princess started this undertaking she was also much
occupied with another all-engrossing subject&mdash;viz.: the improvement of
the condition of poor unmarried women and girls, as well as the
education of girls in general. The Princess found an able assistant in
Fräulein Louise Büchner&mdash;a most distinguished authoress, and the
champion of women’s rights, more particularly of the higher education of
women.</p>

<p>With her help the Princess formed another committee for the
encouragement of “Female Industry.” A permanent Bazaar was established
on the 25th of November, 1867, called after the Princess, “The Alice
Bazaar,” for the purpose of receiving and disposing of articles of
needlework at their proper value, and also for obtaining employment for
women of all classes. The “Bazaar” soon became a flourishing
institution.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year 1867 the Prince and Princess went to Gotha,
where they met the Crown Prince and Princess of Prussia for the first
time since the war. They then went for a few weeks to Berlin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span> After the
threatening rumors of war caused by the Luxembourg question had been
dispersed, the Emperor Napoleon invited all the Sovereigns and Princes
of Europe to visit the great International Exhibition at Paris. Prince
and Princess Louis, amongst others, accepted the invitation, and were at
Paris at the same time as the Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia,
and the Crown Prince and Princess of Prussia. The Prince and Princess
visited many other places of interest and note at Paris besides the
great Exhibition. All institutions for art had a great attraction for
her, and she took up the idea most warmly of founding Schools of Design
in her own country, as she hoped they would exercise a good influence
there.</p>

<p>During the Prince and Princess’ visit the great review of the Imperial
troops in the Bois de Boulogne took place; and on that day, too, the
happily unsuccessful attempt on the Emperor of Russia’s life was made.</p>

<p>After attending all the festivities at the Imperial Court, where the
Prince and Princess received every possible attention and kindness from
the Emperor and Empress, they left Paris on the 10th of June, and,
having met their children at Calais, crossed over to England. During
this stay in England the Princess visited the German and many other
Hospitals, and she also assisted in doing the honors for the Queen at
several Court festivities. She was present at Windsor and Osborne during
the visits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172">{172}</a></span> the Sultan, who had been so cordially received in
England, and in whose honor a great naval review at Spithead was held.</p>

<p>Prince and Princess Louis returned to Darmstadt in the first days of
August; and, having established their children there, they left for St.
Moritz in the Engadine, where they intended to spend a month, and where
the Princess was to take the baths.</p>

<p>Whilst there they made several excursions, travelling about quite
simply, like any other tourists.</p>

<p>On their return to Germany, the Prince and Princess spent a few days
with the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Baden on the island of Mainau
on the Lake of Constance. During the autumn the Princess met several of
her own brothers and sisters. She also went to Cassel to meet the Crown
Prince and Princess of Prussia, who were returning from a visit to
England.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is a great happiness to be with dear Vicky and Fritz, and
the future&mdash;that which is to be feared, that which must inevitably
come&mdash;is of course our constant talk. Whatever comes, our position,
and that of other small sovereigns, must undergo a change, which
for the older ones will be very hard, and which they will ever
feel. Even dear Louis, who is so sensible and reasonable, says he
has been brought up with particular rights, which for centuries
have been ours, and he feels sore that he is never to inherit them.</p>

<p>Dear aunt seems very well, and is ever like a second mother to us,
so loving and kind; also dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173">{173}</a></span> uncle. Papa’s and your children are
dear to him almost as though they were his own; and he lives to see
us with our families and in our homes, whereas darling Papa does
not. Yesterday the <i>Braut von Messina</i> was given&mdash;that beautiful
piece which Papa was so fond of. I thought so much of you.</p>

<p>On Thursday Vicky and Fritz go to Berlin. We remain here until
Sunday afternoon, as on Sunday is the Ordensfest; and as many will
be decorated who fought against us, Louis thought it better to
arrive after the ceremony. Hermann is here still. He has been to
see Feo,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> who has been very ill. Fritz William [the Crown
Prince] saw Ada and Fritz Holstein at Carlsruhe, and Fritz and Anna
of Hesse&mdash;all four turned out of their countries. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I am delighted to hear of dear Arthur having passed so good an
examination. How proud you must be of him! And the good Major,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
who has spared no pains, I know&mdash;how pleased he must be! Arthur has
a uniform now, I suppose.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We remain here a little longer, probably until the following
Saturday, as the King, owing to his cold, could not see us often,
and begged us to remain longer.</p>

<p>I saw Amalie Lauchert<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> here two days ago, looking so well, and
charming as ever.</p>

<p>Little Vicky is such a darling, very like her poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174">{174}</a></span> little
brother&mdash;so merry, so good, one never hears her cry&mdash;and it is
really a comfort to Vicky to have that dear little thing. Poor
Vicky is very sad and low at times.</p>

<p>After intense cold it is quite warm, like spring, which is very
unwholesome and tiring.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I think I can understand what you must feel. I know well what
those first three years were&mdash;what fearful suffering, tearing and
uprooting those feelings which had been centred in beloved Papa’s
existence! It is indeed, as you say “in mercy,” that after the long
storm a lull and calm ensues, though the violent pain, which is but
the reverse side of the violent love, seems only to die out with
it, and that is likewise bitter. Yet, beloved Mama, could it be
otherwise? There would be no justice or mercy, were the first stage
of sorrow to be the perpetual one; and God grant, that time may
still soothe and alleviate that which it cannot change! I can only
imagine what the loss must be, if I measure it by the possession of
that one adored being, who is the centre and essence of my
existence.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, February 28th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday we had a very interesting lecture in our house
about Art in Venice, by a young Swede [Herr von Molin], who has
been studying three years in Italy. We had the room full of people,
artists, and professors, who liked to listen.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;All the natural cleverness and sharpness in the world won’t
serve nowadays, unless one has learnt something. I feel this so
much; and just in our position it is more and more required<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span> and
expected, particularly in a small place, where so much depends on
the personal knowledge and exertions of the Princes.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, March 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The knowledge of dear sweet Alix’s state makes me too sad. It
is hard for them both, and the nursing must be very fatiguing for
Mrs. Clarke. I am so distressed about darling Alix that I really
have no peace. It may, and probably will, last long, which is so
dreadful.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We mean to have some children on the 5th, so that Victoria

<p>My father-in-law is better again, I am happy to say. The warm

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I could not write the other day, as I had a good deal to do
with two committees for charities, which had to be got into order,
and which took up a great deal of my time.</p>

<p>Cold, hail, snow, and rain, have returned; and Irène has got a
cold, which most people here have. The weather is so unpleasant.</p>

<p>We shall stop here in town until we go to England, as we have
nowhere to go to before. It is a pity for the children to have no
country air, and they miss the flowers in their walks. I can’t
praise Orchard<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> enough. Such order she keeps, and is so
industrious and tidy, besides understanding so much about the

<p>Thousand thanks for your dear letter, and for the kind wishes for
Victoria’s birthday! I pray she may be a worthy granddaughter and
goddaughter of my darling Mamma! I shall never forget that
day&mdash;your kindness to us, and the tender nurse you were. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Victoria means to dictate a letter to you; she is so much pleased
with her presents. Irène has not a tooth yet, and is not very fat,
poor little thing! but she is fresh and rosy, and, I think, strong.</p>

<p>This last week the excitement here has been dreadful, as all
anticipated a war with France on account of Luxembourg. I fear
sooner or later it will come. May the Almighty avert such a
calamity!</p>

<p>The Moriers were quite in ecstasies about your handsome present.
The christening<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> went off very well.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We have just returned from church, and to-morrow morning we
all take the Sacrament at nine o’clock in the Schlosskirche.
Professor Jowett is here on a visit to the Moriers, and is going to
read the service on Sunday. I have not had an opportunity to attend
our English service since we were at Windsor, excepting one Sunday
at Berlin with Vicky and Fritz.</p>

<p>People think now, the evil of war is put off for a few weeks, but
that is all. Henry is here for Easter, and says the same from all
he heard at Berlin.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How I wish you may be right in <i>not</i> believing in war. I
always fear it is not Luxem<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177">{177}</a></span>bourg, but the intense jealousy of the
French nation, that they should not be the first on the Continent,
and that Germany is becoming independent and powerful against their
will. Then, again, the Germans feel their new position, and assert
their rights with more force because unanimous, and neither nation
will choose to give in to the other.</p>

<p>The war would be totally useless, and sow no end of dissension and
hatred between the two neighbor countries, who, for their own good
as for that of mankind, ought to live in peace and harmony with
each other.</p>

<p>We seem drifting back to the Middle Ages, as each question is
pushed to the point of the sword. It is most sad. How dear Papa
would have disapproved of much that has happened since 1862!</p>

<p>Is the Catalogue which Mr. Ruland sent some time ago to Mr.
Woodward for dear Papa’s Raphael Collection in print now?<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> So
many people know of its coming out, and are anxious to see it, as,
indeed, I am likewise, for it is the only complete collection in
the world, and the world of art is anxious to know all about it.
Will you, perhaps, let me know through Mr. Sahl,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> as I believe
it is already a good while since you approved of its being
published, and gave the orders for its being printed?</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>As yet none dare to be sure of the peace, but all live again since
there are more chances for its being maintained. But, then, I trust
it will be a permanent peace, not merely a putting off till next
year!</p>

<p>The French press was so very warlike, and it always talks of the
French honor not being able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178">{178}</a></span> allow such a mighty empire as the
German is becoming to gain the upper hand; and then rectification
of her frontiers, always wishing for the Rhine.</p>

<p>Poor little Anna of Mecklenburg is here; it seemed so sad to see
the dear little child come alone to inhabit the rooms its Mama had
never returned to. She looks delicate, very fair, but with dark,
thick eyebrows and eyelashes; rather shy and silent for she has no
little children to play with in her home. My two led her about at
once, and tried to amuse her. Ella, who is five months older, is a
head taller and twice as broad. I am so afraid they will be too
rough with her, for dear, fat Ella is very strong, and by no means
gentle.</p>

<p>Annchen has an old nervous nurse, who is too frightened about her.
It is a great responsibility, where there is no mother. It looks so
sad!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>I must tell you something in confidence of what has taken place
here with regard to Louis. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Since Louis took the command last
August, and since the Convention with Prussia has been settled,
Louis has been opposed by Uncle Louis and the <i>Kriegsministerium</i>
[War Department], in doing all the things which he thought
absolutely necessary, and which toward Prussia the Grand Duke had
promised to do, so as to get the troops into the necessary order
and organization. Here the Government is, Louis has reason to fear,
once more playing a false game toward Prussia, and all his true
friends and a small party of the clever-thinking people have
encouraged him in the idea that to serve his country, he <i>may</i> and
<i>must</i> not be implicated in the present sad and desperate state of
affairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span></p>

<p>It has cost him a great struggle to make up his mind to ask Uncle
Louis to accept his resignation, which he has been obliged to
demand, as he felt that under present circumstances he could not
fulfil what was desired of him.</p>

<p>Uncle Louis may refuse to let him go; then he intends to ask for
leave until the 1st of October, the date when the Convention must
be carried out, when he hopes and trusts the King will send a
Prussian general to put all in order.</p>

<p>Uncle Louis and his <i>Umgebung</i> [the people about him] will all be
against my Louis, as they think it a shame and injustice to give up
any of their rights, and that it is unpardonable of Louis to act up
to what he has always said. He is so good a nephew, that all this
will be dreadfully painful to him; but he is quite convinced that
his duty to his country and his future demands this step of him. He
is obliged to go away from here, as he does not think it right for
him to be always in opposition to Uncle Louis, and as he cannot
gain by it what the country and the troops require. On account of
all these reasons he considers it right to leave.</p>

<p>He wished me to write all this to you, as he knows you will
understand and not disapprove the confidence he bestows on one, on
whose opinion he quite relies. He looks forward so much to coming
to England, as he is worried and harassed by all that has happened.
In all this he has again shown, as of old, that he always places
<i>himself</i> and his <i>wishes</i> and <i>feelings</i> in the background, and
that to serve others and to do his duty are the sole aims of his
existence. He will, as soon as he has received an answer from the
Grand Duke, telegraph to you to settle our plans. The children are
overjoyed at the prospect of seeing their dear Grandmama again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180">{180}</a></span></p>

<p>I am not up to very much, I don’t always feel quite strong; but the
change will do me good, I am sure.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>The Grand Duke has not as yet consented to Louis’ resignation.
Louis has made conditions, under which it will be possible for him
to remain, if Uncle L. consents. The first condition is to have a
Prussian officer at his side. The Grand Duke declared he would
sooner lose his country than give his consent to that. Louis has
now officially written his letter of requirements, and sent it.
But, whatever happens, he will be able to get a short leave, he
thinks, by the beginning of June.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>The military affair is at length settled. Uncle Louis has given in
to the points Louis demanded, and he retains his command. All are
astonished at Louis’ unlooked-for success in this affair, and as
Uncle L. would not have a Prussian General, and had no one here to
take in Louis’ stead, who could do the things well, he had to agree
and to allow what Louis was justified in asking. Louis’ firmness
and decision have done great good, and all are thankful to him for
it, though others, who ought to do as he has done, have never shown
the courage.</p>

<p>Louis is laid up with the most awful nettle-rash all over face and
body, and is so unwell with it. He has had it now three days.
Altogether since the winter, or rather since the war, he has had so
much cause for vexation, that he has been constantly unwell; and
each time he is much worried he has an attack of illness.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, June 9th.<br />
</p>

<p>I really am half killed from sight-seeing and fêtes, but all has
interested me so much, and the Emperor and Empress [of the French]
have been most kind. Yesterday was the ball at the Hôtel de Ville,
quite the same as it had been for you and dear Papa, and there were
more than 8,000 people there. It was the finest sight I have ever
seen, and it interested me all the more, as I knew it was the same
as in the year when you were at Paris.</p>

<p>Every morning we went to the Exhibition, and every evening there
was a dinner or ball. It was most fatiguing. To-morrow morning we
leave, and had really great trouble to get away, for the Emperor
and Empress and others begged us so much to remain for the ball at
the Tuileries to-morrow night; but we really could not, on account
of Wednesday’s concert,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> as we should barely arrive in time.</p>

<p>The <i>attentat</i> on the Emperor of Russia was dreadful, and we were
close by at the time. The Empress can’t get over it, and she does
not leave Uncle Sache’s<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> side for an instant now, and takes him
everywhere in her carriage.</p>

<p>To-day we are going with the whole Court to Versailles. Dear Vicky
is gone. She was so low the last days, and dislikes going to
parties so much just now, that she was longing to get home. The
King [of Prussia] wished them both to stop, but only Fritz
remained. How sad these days will be for her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182">{182}</a></span> poor love! She was
in such good looks; every one here is charmed with her.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>[During the months of June and July, 1867, the Princess with her family
was on a visit in England.]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, August 4th.<br />
</p>

<p>We arrived here at midnight on Friday and I was so knocked up *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
that I was incapable of doing any thing yesterday.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;My poor Willem<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> was buried yesterday. Every one regrets
the poor child, for he was very dear. I miss him so much here, for
he did every thing for me, and liked being about me and the
children. All our servants went to the burial. It quite upset me
here not to find him, for I was really attached to him, and he
learnt so well, and was in many ways so nice, though of course
troublesome too at times. How short life is, and the instant one is
gone, he is so wiped away for others, and one knows <i>so</i> absolutely
<i>nothing</i> about the person any more! Were it not for a strong faith
in a future, it would indeed be cruel to bear. No one of the family
is here. We leave to-morrow for Zürich, where we shall be at ten at
night; the next day to Chur, and the next day to St. Moritz.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">St. Moritz</span>, August 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>With perfect weather we accomplished our journey perfectly, and
were enchanted with the beautiful scenery from Zürich here, not to
speak of this place.</p>

<p>The first day&mdash;5th&mdash;we left Darmstadt at 11 <small>A.M.</small>, and did not reach
Zürich till eleven at night. We got two little rooms in the Hôtel
Baur, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183">{183}</a></span> whole place was full. The next morning after
breakfast we went to look at the lovely lake, which is green and
quite transparent. It was a beautiful warm morning. We left by rail
at ten, partly along the lake of Zürich and then along the
Wallenstädter See, which is long and narrow, with high
perpendicular mountains down to the water&mdash;very wild and
picturesque. This lake likewise is of that marvellous green color.
We reached Chur at three that afternoon&mdash;a pretty small town,
situated close up against a mountain. We visited a beautiful old
church there, which contains fine old pictures and relics; it was
built in the time of the Romans, and is still the chief church of
the bishopric.</p>

<p>The next morning we two, with Sarah, Logoz and our footman, left at
six o’clock in a diligence (we both sitting in the coupé in front)
with four horses, for here the road is the grandest one can
imagine, perpetually ascending for two hours, and then descending
again, always along precipices, and the horses at a quick trot
turning sharp round the corners&mdash;which, I assure you is a trial to
the best nerves. We drove over the Julier Pass, which was a road
already used by the Romans, and which is almost the highest in
Switzerland. One passes close to the top of the mountains, which
have snow on them, and are wild and rugged like the top of
Lochnagar. Lower down, the mountains are covered with bright green
grass and fir trees, but rocks look out everywhere, and there are
constantly lovely water-falls.</p>

<p>After crossing the Pass, we drove down&mdash;very steep, of course
nothing on the edge of the road, always zigzag, and at a sharp
trot&mdash;for some distance down to Silva Plana, where the view over
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_184" id="page_184">{184}</a></span> valley and lakes of the Engadine, where St. Moritz lies, is
beyond description beautiful.</p>

<p>We reach this in the evening at six o’clock, the weather being most
beautiful. The Curhaus is below the town, and looks like a large
asylum. It is overfilled with people. We have two rooms, but our
people as yet, none, though they hope for some to-morrow.</p>

<p>I saw Dr. Berry, a little Swiss man, and he recommended me to take
the baths twice a week, besides drinking the waters; which I have
begun this morning at seven o’clock, the usual hour, as one has to
walk up and down a quarter of an hour between the glasses. The bath
I took at ten. It is tepid and also iron water, which bubbles like
soda water, and makes one feel as if insects were crawling over
one.</p>

<p>Lina Aumale is here, the Parises and Nemours. Fritz and Louise [of
Baden] leave to-morrow. This afternoon we drove with them, in two
funny little “Wageli” with one horse, to Samaden, where Louise went
into the hotel to see Mme. d’Usedom, who was lately upset with her
carriage off the road, as there is no barrier, and hurt herself
severely. We saw her brother likewise.</p>

<p>I have sent you a nosegay of Edelweiss and other Alp flowers. I
hope it won’t arrive quite dead. You must fancy them alive, and, if
they could speak, they would tell you how much I love you, and how
constantly I think of you, and of my dear, dear home!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">St. Moritz</span>, August 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;All the Orleans’ left this place suddenly yesterday, as there
are three cases of scarlatina in the house. We consulted the doctor
immediately, whether he thought it safe for Louis to remain, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_185" id="page_185">{185}</a></span>
never having had it, and he said, “Perfectly, as we are at the
other end of the house, and out nearly all day.”</p>

<p>Victor and Lolo [Count and Countess Gleichen] are here, and we went
out drawing together yesterday; but it is too difficult here. I
think constantly how much you would admire this place: it is indeed
exquisitely beautiful&mdash;much the finest I have ever seen. It is very
wild and reminds me in parts of dear Scotland.</p>

<p>You say that our home in England is dull now for those who like to
amuse themselves. It is <i>never</i> dull, darling Mama, when one can be
with you, for I have indeed never met a more agreeable charming
companion. Time always flies by when one is with you. I hope it is
not impertinent my saying so.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">St. Moritz</span>, August 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I knew you would feel for me at the loss of my poor Willem.
Of course one must feel that sort of loss more than that of many a
relation, if one knew the latter but little. I said to Louis at the
time, that Willem’s death distressed me more than would that of
several relations who were not intimate with me. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Yesterday we and the Gleichens went to the Rosegg Glacier, and to
get there had to go from Pontresina in little <i>Bergwagen</i>, which
are strong miniature <i>Leiterwagen</i> without springs, and we went
over a horrid path with quantities of stones, so the shaking was
beyond description.</p>

<p>Victor and Lolo go mostly with us and we always dine together.</p>

<p>I take three glasses beginning at seven in the morning, and a bath
at eight. One lies in a wooden thing, covered over up to one’s chin
with boards, and remains so twenty minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span></p>

<p>We lunch at twelve and dine at half-past six, and go to bed early.
We are out nearly all day long. It is very warm, the sun scorching;
my face is quite red-brown, in spite of veils and parasols. I feel
already very much better, and Louis says my face is quite fat. I
wish we could remain longer than the end of the month, but Louis
must be home.</p>

<p>I hope you notice the pains I take with my writing, for you
complained of it at Osborne&mdash;I fear, justly&mdash;and I am trying to
improve it again.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">St. Moritz</span>, August 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday we made a beautiful expedition, which it may amuse you to
hear of, as in an exaggerated way it reminded me of our nice Scotch
ones. The evening before we left with Victor and Lolo (without
servants) about eight o’clock for Pontresina. The country looked
more beautiful than ever in the brightest moonlight. We found two
very small but clean rooms in an hotel outside the village.</p>

<p>The next morning we got up at half-past four, dressed, and
breakfasted, then got on four horses with most uncomfortable
saddles, with our guide Adam Engler, an amusing man, most active
and helpful. We saw the sun rising over the snow-covered mountains,
and the valleys gradually coming out clearer.</p>

<p>We were to ascend the Piz Languard, a mountain 1,200 feet high. We
rode for two hours by a worse and much steeper road than up the
Glassalt, then walked over rocks, sand, and slippery grass, so
steep that one could not look up to see where one was going to,
quite precipitous on each side, leaving snow and glacier below us.
The last bit has a sort of immensely high steps hewn in the rock.
After an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_187" id="page_187">{187}</a></span> hour and a half’s hard labor we reached the summit, which
is rocky and small&mdash;enormous precipices all round. Poor Lolo was
giddy for some time, which was very unpleasant. The view from the
top is most extensive. The Italian, Swiss, and Tyrolese Alps are
all to be seen, but the view was not very clear. We rested and ate
something, and drank some Lochnagar whisky. The sun was getting
intense. We commenced our descent at eleven o’clock, and had to
walk the whole way back, for one can’t ride down. We did not reach
Pontresina till nearly four, as we had to rest several times, our
limbs ached so, for there is no level ground the whole way, and the
stones slip, and it was very hot. I had quite sore feet with
blisters all over, so that the last hours were really agonizing.
But it is a thing to have done, and the view amply repaid one,
though one does not feel tempted to do it a second time. I feel
very well, excepting my face, (which is still burning and quite
red), and my unfortunate feet.</p>

<p>Poor Christa wrote to me yesterday, and says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I must also tell your Royal Highness that I have received a letter
in her own hand from Her Majesty the Queen. I cannot express how
deeply this has moved me and filled me with gratitude. God bless
the Queen for her rare human love; for surely there is no one, who
in such a position as hers, has preserved a heart like hers, so
full of kindness and sympathy for others.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Dear sweet Mama, your kind and sisterly words have been balsam to
many a wounded heart, and many are the blessings that have been
craved for you from above by hearts filled with thankfulness for
your true sympathy.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188">{188}</a></span></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Now I will tell you of our expedition. Louis and I, Victor
and Lolo, and a guide, with each a small bag, left this early on
the morning of the 17th (dear Grandmama’s birthday) in a carriage
for Pontresina; from thence, in two of those shaky <i>Bergwagen</i>,
over part of the Bernina Pass, past the magnificent Morteratsch
Glacier, which we saw perfectly. The guide told us he had been
there with Professor Tyndall, and that the latter had observed that
the glacier advanced a foot a day in the warm weather, and old
people recollect it having been a mile higher up. We soon left the
high-road, and all vegetation, save grass, for a bad path into the
Val da Fain. The heat was again intense. We lunched and rested, and
then took the horses out of the carts for us ladies to ride. The
scenery was wild and severe, until we began again to descend, and
came down upon the lovely Livigno Valley, which is Italian, and
covered with brown châlets. We reached the village of Livigno, with
only wooden huts, by six o’clock, and turned into a funny little
dark inn, in which we four found one small but clean room for
us&mdash;most primitive. As the inhabitants speak a sort of Italian, we
had the greatest difficulty to make ourselves understood. Victor
cooked part of the dinner, and it was quite good.</p>

<p>We all slept&mdash;I resting <i>on</i> a bed, the other three on the
floor&mdash;in this little room, with the small window wide open.</p>

<p>The next morning we left at nine, and drove on no road in such a
small carriage&mdash;of course, no springs&mdash;our husbands at first
getting a lift on the horses, without saddles; then on foot up a
steep and dangerous ascent. Splendid weather, but too hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span> We went
over the Pass of the Stretta: a more difficult and rough ground I
never crossed in my life, but splendid scenery. We came on a view
which was glorious&mdash;such enormous snow-covered mountains and
glaciers, with the green valleys deep below looking on Italy and
the Tyrol.</p>

<p>We reached Bormio by seven, and took up our residence at a
bathing-place, quite magnificently situated, very high up&mdash;also
Italian. The next morning we started early in carriages, and went
over the Stelvio Pass. There, nearly at the risk of my neck, I
picked for the first time some Edelweiss, which I am very proud of,
as it is always difficult and rare to get.</p>

<p>We got down to St. Maria, which is at the upper end of the
Münsterthal and belongs to Switzerland. In the afternoon,
dreadfully hot, I was very thirsty and drank off a glass of milk;
but how it tasted! It was goat’s milk; the people keep the cow’s
milk for butter and cheese. We remained the night there, and left
the next morning for here, by Zernetz and Ofen. To get from one
valley into another, one has always to ascend and descend enormous
heights, and always by narrow paths at the edge of precipices. We
enjoyed our tour immensely, and got on perfectly without servants.
Packing up my things, though, every morning was a great trouble,
and the bag would usually not shut at first. The trees growing here
are splendid larches and arven<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>; the latter grow only in these
very high regions and in Siberia. Victor and his wife are most
amiable and pleasant travelling-companions, and pleased with every
thing; not minding to rough it, which we had to do.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap">Schloss Mainau</span>, August 30th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We left St. Moritz at seven, and reached Chur at seven in the
evening. The next day we came on here to Louise of Baden. Fritz is
at Carlsruhe. This place is very lovely, though, alas! the fine
mountains are gone, which one always misses so much.</p>

<p>I thought of you more than I can say on the dear 26th, and I felt
low and sad all day. Dear Papa! Time has not yet accustomed us to
see each anniversary come round again, and he still remain away. It
is so inexpressibly hard for you, and you must feel such intense
longing for the dear past. There remains a future! that is the only
consolation.</p>

<p>To-day we went with Louise by carriage, and then across part of the
lake to the property of the Emperor Napoleon, Arenenberg, which the
Empress gave him eight years ago, and which was his home with his
mother, and where she died. Every picture and bit of furniture is
replaced as it was when the Emperor lived there, and he was there
himself and replaced every thing. It is quite a page in history to
see all the things that surrounded the Emperor in the days of his
misfortune.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I spent three days and two nights with dear Alix at
Wiesbaden, and I find her leg decidedly better. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is a
little less hot to-day, but much hotter even now than we ever have
in England. Stallmeister Meyer<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> came to see us yesterday, and we
took him out riding, which made him quite happy. Any one who
reminds me of the good old times before the 14th of December does
me good; it is a pleasure to speak about those past, so happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span>
days! When they came to a close, I lost the greater part of my
joyousness, which, though I am so happy, has never returned. A
certain melancholy and sadness sometimes overcome me, which I can’t
shake off; then I have <i>Heimweh</i> after adored Papa to such an
extent that tears are my only relief.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The King of Prussia’s visit went off very well here, and both
high personages seemed pleased to have got over the meeting. The
King came most kindly to see us, and went over all our rooms, which
seemed to amuse him. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday evening Sache and Minnie<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
arrived, and we intend going over to see them all to-morrow.</p>

<p>Louis will retain the command, but, according to the King’s advice,
has demanded a Prussian General Stabschef [Chief of the Staff],
which will be a great assistance to him.</p>

<p>At the sale of the Homburg things I bought a lovely miniature of
dear Grandmama in a black velvet gown, with a red shawl over her
shoulder&mdash;shortly after her marriage, I think.</p></div>

<p>Yesterday evening I returned from Wiesbaden, leaving Alix well, but
having caught a bad cold myself. The children have equally heavy
ones.</p></div>

</p>

<p>Many thanks for your letter just received, and for the review of
dear Papa’s Life, which is excellent, and which I sent on to Aunt
Feodore, as you desired. I have been laid up for a week with
influenza, and am only about again since yesterday, though not out
of the house. I am quite weak from it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span> whole house is laid up
with bad colds, and baby can’t shake her’s off at all. The cough is
so tiring, and she whoops whenever she coughs. Poor Jäger, who is,
alas! we fear, consumptive, broke a blood-vessel two days ago, and
is dangerously ill, to the great grief of all in the house. He is
our best servant, and so devoted; he never would take care of
himself, as he could not bear letting any one but himself attend on
Louis. We have just got a <i>Diakonissin</i> [Deaconness] to nurse him;
on account of his great weakness he can’t be left alone one
instant.</p>

<p>Sir William, Lady, and Charlotte Knollys have been on a visit to
us; also Lady Geraldine Somerset for two nights. They are all
interested to see our house.</p>

<p>Uncle George has made me a present of one of the horses the Sultan
sent him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>I can’t find words to say how sorry I am that dear sweet Arthur
should have the small-pox! and that you should have this great
anxiety and worry. God grant that the dear boy may get well over
it, and that his dear handsome face be not marked! Where in the
world could he have caught it? The Major kindly telegraphs daily,
and you can fancy, far away, how anxious one is. I shall be very
anxious to get a letter with accounts, for I think constantly of
him, and of you. My parents-in-law wish me to tell you how they
share your anxiety, and how they wish soon to hear of dear Arthur’s
convalescence; of course my Louis likewise, for he shares all my
feelings, being a real brother towards my <i>Geschwister</i> [brothers
and sisters].</p>

<p>We both paid the King of Prussia our respects at Frankfort this
morning, principally to tell him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_193" id="page_193">{193}</a></span> Bertie had been so grieved
at the ill success of his intended visit, as the Queen begged us to
do.</p>

<p>I am better to-day, but Ella and Irène can’t shake off their colds,
and poor Ella is altogether unwell. Victoria is all right.</p>

<p>We are going on the 18th to Baden for Fritz’s birthday.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>How glad I am to see by your letter that darling Arthur is going on
so very well. One can’t be too thankful; and it is a good thing
over, and will spare one’s being anxious about him on other
occasions.</p>

<p>Bertie and Alix have been here since Saturday afternoon, and leave
to-morrow. They go straight to Antwerp, and Bertie is going back to
Brussels to see the cousins.</p>

<p>The visit of the King went off very well, and Alix was pleased with
the kindness and civility of the King. I hear that the meeting was
satisfactory to both parties, which I am heartily glad of. Bearing
ill-will is always a mistake, besides its not being right.</p>

<p>Dear Alix walked up our staircase with two sticks, of course very
slowly, but she is improving wonderfully, though her knee is quite
stiff.</p>

<p>Poor Jäger is a little better, and the momentary danger is past,
though I fear he cannot ultimately recover. How hard for poor
Katrinchen! There is much sorrow in the world, and how often such a
share falls to the best and gentlest! I, of course, go to see him
daily, but it always goes to my very heart to see that attached and
faithful creature dying slowly away. How is Brown’s sister?</p>

<p>We hope that Countess Blücher will return here with Vicky and me
from Baden for a few days, as it is an age since Vicky has seen
her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span></p>

<p>Dear Alix is writing in my room at this moment, and is so dear and
sweet. She is a most lovable creature.</p></div>

<p>I have had the pleasure of having Augusta and the Dean [Stanley]
here since yesterday, but they leave again this morning.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia is here to-day, and there is a large dinner for
him in the Schloss, and he is kind enough to come and see me
afterward.</p>

<p>The accounts of poor dear Aunt Feodore are so sad, and I hear she
does not look well, and is so low about her eyes and being unable
to see you again after so long a separation. She seems alone and
lonely, with old age and sickness coming over her. If I had been
well, I should have gone to see her. I am much better these last
days. I can breathe much better, but the dreadfully swelled ankles
and wrists remain as bad as before, and cause great discomfort and
even pain. I never had this before.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Schweinsberg</span>, October 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>Dear Vicky and Fritz left us yesterday morning. It is such a
pleasure to me to think that they, like Bertie and Alix, know my
house, and that they have lodged under our roof. When will you,
darling Mama? If ever again you go abroad and wish to rest on your
way, all in the world we have is at your disposal. How happy that
would make us!</p>

<p>We ourselves left at four yesterday afternoon, remaining the night
at Marburg, and leaving at a quarter to five in the morning, so
that Louis could reach Alsfeld in time to join the shooting-party.
We parted at Kirchhain, and I came here with Christa to her
mother’s house&mdash;so sad and changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195">{195}</a></span> since three years ago. It is
most kind of them to have taken me up here, and the bracing air
will do me good. They know that I can understand what a house of
mourning is, and that I don’t want to amuse myself.</p>

<p>Ella cried on parting with us yesterday, and wanted to get into the
train with us.</p>

<p>Victoria is going to have a little lesson every other day, when I
go back, from Mr. Geyer, who taught poor Willem, and who teaches
little girls particularly well. She must begin in my room, as it is
better not to have lessons in the nursery, I think. Vicky and I
spoke much together about education and taking a governess. I
thought to wait a year (for financial reasons), and I think it time
enough then&mdash;do not you?</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We arrived late at Baden, and Vicky and Fritz, who had had
two long days’ journey, were very tired; but we had to go to dress
at once, to go to a <i>soirée</i> at Madame Viardot’s, which lasted till
midnight, and at which the King and Queen were present. Her
daughters and scholars sang a little operetta she had composed,
which was very pretty.</p>

<p>I hope the inauguration of the statue went off as well as the
weather would permit.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is so good and wholesome not always to be one’s own
master, and to have to suit one’s self to the wish of others, and,
above all, to that of one’s mother and sovereign. &mdash;&mdash; feels it as
such, and often told me so, regretting how seldom such was the
case.</p>

<p>The Moriers are often with us, and we value them much; they are
such pleasant companions, and such excellent, clever people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The visit to Claremont must have been quite peculiar for you;
and I can fancy it bringing back to your mind the recollections of
your childhood. In spring it must be a lovely place, and, with
gayer papers on the walls, and a little modern comfort, the house
must likewise be very pleasant. Ella, who was breakfasting with me
just now, saw me dip my <i>Bretzel</i> in my coffee, and said: “Oh,
Mama, you must not! Do you allow yourself to do that?” because I
don’t allow her to do it. She is too funny, and by no means quite
easy to manage&mdash;a great contrast to Victoria, who is a very
tractable child. Ella has a wonderful talent for sewing, and, when
she keeps quiet a little while, sews quite alone and without
mistakes. She is making something for you for Christmas, which she
is quite excited about. Victoria’s little afternoon lesson answers
admirably, and is the happiest time of the day for her. She can
read words already.</p>

<p>We have snow and ice, and no sunshine since some time, and it is
not inviting to take the dull walks in the town. But I make a rule
to go out twice a day, and keep nearly the same hours as at home.</p>

<p>The account of your visit to Lady Palmerston and to her daughter is
most touching. It is so inexpressibly sad for grandmother and
mother, for it is unnatural for parents to survive their children,
and that makes the grief a so peculiar one, and very hard to bear.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 9th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;During the long winter days, when Louis is away sometimes
four times in the week from six in the morning till six in the
evening, and then when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span> returns from his shooting has his work
to do, I feel lonely. I am often for several hours consecutively
quite by myself; and for my meals and walks only a lady, as she is
the only person in the house besides ourselves. It is during these
hours, when one cannot always be reading or at work, that I should
wish to have some one to go to, or to come to me to sit and speak
with; but such is not the case, and it is this I regret&mdash;accustomed
as I was to a house full of people, with brothers and sisters, and
above all, the chance of being near you. I always feel how
willingly I would spend some of those hours with or near you&mdash;and
the sea ever lies between us! When Louis is at home and free&mdash;for
in the morning I don’t see him&mdash;then I have <i>all</i> that this world
can give me, for I am indeed never happier than at his dear side;
and time only increases our affection, and binds us closer to each
other.</p>

<p>We have deep snow now and sledging the last two days.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 12th.<br />
</p>

<p>Before going to rest, I take up my pen to write a few loving words
that they may reach you on the morning of the 14th. The sound of
that date brings with it that sad and dreary recollection which,
for you, my poor dear Mama, and for us, time cannot alter. As long
as our lives last, this time of year must fill us with sad and
earnest feelings, and revive the pain of that bitter parting.</p>

<p>I ought not to dwell on those hours now, for it is wrong to open
those wounds afresh, which God in His mercy finds little ways and
means to heal and soothe the pain of.</p>

<p>Dear darling Papa is, and ever will be <i>immortal</i>. The good he has
done; the great ideas he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span> promulgated in the world; the noble
and unselfish example he has given, will live on, as I am sure he
must ever do, as one of the best, purest, most God-like men that
have come down into this world. His example will, and does,
stimulate others to higher and purer aims; and I am convinced that
darling Papa did not live in vain. His great mission was done; and
what has remained undone he has placed in your dear hands, who will
know best how to achieve his great works of love and justice. I
shall think much, very much, of you on the 14th, and you will be
more in my prayers than ever. Think also a little of your most
devoted child!</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, Christmas Day.<br />
</p>

<p>We missed poor Willem so much in arranging all the things; and poor
Jäger’s illness was also sad. We gave him a tree in his room. He
looks like a shadow, and his voice is quite hoarse.</p>

<p>To two hospitals, the military and the town one, I took presents
yesterday, and saw many a scene of suffering and grief. My children
are going to give a certain number of poor children a <i>Bescheerung</i>
on New Year’s Day. It is so good to teach them early to be generous
and kind to the poor. They even wish to give some of their own
things, and such as are <i>not</i> broken.</p>

<p>Your many generous presents will find their use at once, and the
Christmas pie, etc., be shared by all the family. The remembrances
of those bright happy Christmases at Windsor are constantly before
me. None will ever be again what those were, without you, dear
Papa, and dear kind Grandmama.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 27th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am sure you will have felt under<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span> many a circumstance in
life, that if any momentary feeling was upon you, and you were
writing to some one near and dear, it did you good to put down
those feelings on paper, and that, even in the act of doing so,
when the words were barely written, the feeling had begun to die
away, and the intercourse had done you good.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the winter season brought many social duties with it, the
Princess’ active personal attention to all those good works and
institutions which she had called into existence never flagged. No
subject of interest or importance escaped her, and her time was always
fully occupied. In April she met the Crown Prince at Gotha, where Prince
Louis also came, on his return from Munich, to fetch her. She spent the
months of June and July in England with her three little girls, either
at Osborne, Windsor, or in London. The return journey to Darmstadt was
made by water as far as Mayence. The autumn was spent at Kranichstein,
in the neighborhood of which the manœuvres of the Hessian division took
place, at some of which the Princess was present.</p>

<p>On the 25th of November, to the great joy of the parents and the
country, a son and heir was born&mdash;“a splendid boy.” At his christening,

Duke, the names Ernst Ludwig&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span> had been borne by so many of the

<p>What a fright the news of dear Leopold’s dangerous attack has given
us! Mr. Sahl’s letter to Becker arrived yesterday afternoon
containing the bad news, and he spoke of so <i>little</i> hope, that I
was so upset and so dreadfully distressed for the dear darling, for
you, poor Mama, and for us all, that I am quite unwell still
to-day.</p>

<p>When your telegram came to-day, and Louise’s letter, I was so
relieved and only pray and hope that the improvement may continue.
May God spare that young bright and gifted life, to be a comfort
and support to you for many a year to come!</p>

<p>Had I only had a telegram! for, the letter being two days old,
until your telegram came I passed six such agonizing hours! Away
from home, every news of illness or sorrow there is so difficult to
bear&mdash;when one can share all the anxiety and trouble only <i>in
thought</i>.</p>

<p>The day passes so slowly without news, and I am always looking
toward the door to see if a telegram is coming. Please let me hear
regularly till he is quite safe; I do love the dear boy, as I do
all my brothers and sisters, so tenderly!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201">{201}</a></span></p>

<p>How I wish you had been spared this new anxiety! Those two days
must have been dreadful!</p>

<p>Darling Mama, how I wish I were with you! God grant that in future
you may send us only good news.</p>

the family join.</p></div>

<p>How glad and truly thankful I am, that the Almighty has saved our
darling Leopold and spared him to you and to us all! For the second
or even third time that life has been given again, when all feared
that it must leave us! A mother’s heart must feel this so much more
than any other one’s, and dear Leopold, through having caused you
all his life so much anxiety, must be inexpressibly dear to you,
and such an object to watch over and take care of. Indeed from the
depth of my heart I thank God with you for having so mercifully
spared dear Leo, and watched over him when death seemed so near!</p>

<p>You will feel deeply now the great joy of seeing a convalescence
after the great danger, and I know, through a thousand little
things, how your loving and considerate heart will find pleasure
and consolation in cheering your patient.</p>

<p>That for the future you must ever be so anxious is a dreadful
trial, but it is to be hoped that Leo will yet outgrow this strange
illness. I am sure good Archie<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> takes great care of him, and by
this time he will have gathered plenty of experience to be a good
nurse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202">{202}</a></span></p>

<p>Baby is better, but her poor head and face are perfectly covered
with spots, and she was in despair with the smarting and itching,
and of course rubbed herself quite sore. Ella has it slightly since
this morning.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;First let me wish you joy for the birth of this new
grandson,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> born on your dear wedding-day. I thought of you on
the morning of the 10th, and meant to telegraph, but those dreadful
neuralgic pains came on before I had time to look about me, and
really laid me prostrate for the whole day, as they lasted so very
long. I have never felt so unwell, or suffered so much in my life,
and this moment, sitting up in Louis’ room, I feel more weak than I
have ever felt on first getting up after my confinements. Quinine
has kept me free from pain to-day, and I hope will do so to-morrow.
I have been in bed a week and touched absolutely nothing all the
time. Yesterday evening, as throughout the day, I had had (but much
more slightly) a return of these agonizing attacks, which seized my
left eye, ear, and the whole left side of my head and nose. I got
up and sat in Louis’ room; I could only bear it for two hours, and
all but fainted before I reached my bed. If I can get strength, and
have no return of pain, I hope to go out after to-morrow. I could
not see the children or any one during this week, and always had my
eyes closed, first from pain, and then from exhaustion when the
pain left me. I really thought I should go out of my mind, and you
know I can stand a tolerable amount of pain.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">{203}</a></span></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am so distressed that you remained so long without news. I
was really for a whole week quite incapable of <i>any idea</i> about any
thing, and had mostly my eyes shut, and was constantly alone, as I
could not bear any one in the room.</p>

<p>General Plonsky, the Corps Commandant from Cassel, came here
unexpectedly, and Louis, being under his command, was so taken up
during those days, besides an immense deal of military business,
that I never saw him more than a few minutes in the morning; and
during his free time in the afternoon he sat, like the best nurse
in the world, near my bed in the dark room, putting wet rags on my
head and trying by every possible means to alleviate my pains. He
was touching in the great care he took of me. Louis and Harriet did
all for me, and I could bear no one else about me. You see, poor
Louis had no time to write, and he always thought that I should be
well the next day and write myself.</p></div>

<p>To my and, I fear, dear Vicky’s great disappointment, Dr. Weber
won’t let me go to Berlin, and wants me to go to Wiesbaden for a
cold-water cure instead. The latter will be intensely dull, as I
shall be there for four weeks all alone; but I believe it will be
very beneficial, as with every year I seem to get more rheumatic,
which at my age is of course not good.</p>

<p>We shall hope to be able to come to Windsor, middle of June, as you
desire. The exact time you will kindly let us know later.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Louis left yesterday morning for Mu<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204">{204}</a></span>nich. It is a twelve
hours’ journey. There is a procession on foot at the funeral, going
to the church through the town, which will last about two hours,
and then a very long ceremony in the large, cold Basilica.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, March 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>I send you a few lines to-day for the 16th, the anniversary of the
first great sorrow which broke in upon your happy life. How well do
I recollect how I accompanied you and dear Papa down to Frogmore
that night, our dinner in the flower room, the dreadful watching in
the corridor, and then the so painful end! Darling Papa looked so
pale, so deeply distressed, and was so full of tender sympathy for
you. He told me to go to you and comfort you, and was so full of
love and commiseration as I have never seen any man before or
after. Dear, sweet Papa! that in that same year we should live
together through such another heart-rending scene again, and he not
there to comfort or support you, poor Mama!</p>

<p>It sometimes, even at this distance of time, seems nearly
impossible that we should have lived through such times, and yet be
alive and resigned.</p>

<p>God’s mercy is indeed great; for He sends a balm to soothe and heal
the bruised and faithful heart, and to teach one to accommodate
one’s self to one’s sorrow, so as to know how to bear it!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, April 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Louis is in a most unpleasant crisis with the Ministry and
the Grand Duke. I don’t know how it will end.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, April 5th.<br />
</p>

<p>Only two words to-day, as my heart is so full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_205" id="page_205">{205}</a></span> love and
gratitude to you who took such care of me this day five years ago,
who heard Victoria’s first cry, and were such a comfort and help to
us both. All these recollections make Victoria doubly dear to us,
and, as in this world one never knows what will happen, I hope that
you will always watch over our dear child, and let her be as dear
to you as though she had been one of us.</p>

<p>We have spent the day very sadly and quietly together. Louis’
affairs have taken such a turn that he has been obliged to tender
the Grand Duke his resignation, as he does not consider it
compatible with his honor to remain, under existing circumstances.
He has made a great sacrifice to his duty and honor, but doing
one’s duty brings the reward with it of a clear conscience.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 3d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The King of Prussia has sent General von Bonin here to speak
seriously with the Grand Duke, and prove to him through papers,
etc., that he has not kept his word, and that he has been very
badly advised, and that Louis was quite in the right. The result
has been that the poor Grand Duke is scandalized at the state of
affairs, and that he really seems to have been more in the dark
than was supposed. He gives Louis the command again, sends away the
whole <i>Kriegsministerium</i> [War Department], to be reorganized more
simply, and with other people, according to Louis’ proposals; and
so all <i>military</i> affairs will be in order, and Louis have much
greater power to carry out all that has to be done.</p>

<p>We are so pleased at all having turned out thus far well, and know
that you will share our feelings. Louis gets more work and a great
responsibility;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206">{206}</a></span> but he has proved himself so capable in every
respect, so active and hard-working, that I think and trust he will
overcome all difficulties.</p>

<p>I go alone to Gotha, and Louis will follow as soon as he can, so as
to spend my birthday there.</p>

<p>I am so distressed at dear, good Sir James [Clark’s] illness. I
hope and trust that this precious old friend will still be spared
for a few years at least.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Gotha</span>, April 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is now eleven years since I spent my birthday with dear
Vicky, and she has been so dear and kind, and dear Aunt and Uncle
likewise. We spend the day quite quietly together, and the bad
weather prevents any expeditions.</p>

<p>After to-morrow we go home.</p></div>

</p>

<p>Accept my best thanks for your last letter written on dear Arthur’s
birthday. The playing of the band I am sure gave him pleasure; but
it would be too painful for <i>all</i> ever to have it again on the
terrace as formerly. There are certain tunes which that Marine Band
used to play, which, when I have chanced to hear them elsewhere,
have quite upset me, so powerful does the recollection of those so
very happy birthdays at Osborne remain upon me! Those happy, happy
days touch me even to tears when I think of them. What a joyous
childhood we had, and how greatly it was enhanced by dear, sweet
Papa, and by all your great kindness to us!</p>

<p>I try to copy as much as lies in my power all these things for our
children, that they may have an idea, when I speak to them of it,
of what a happy home ours was.</p>

<p>I do feel so much for dear Beatrice and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_207" id="page_207">{207}</a></span> younger ones,
who had so much less of it than we had!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, May 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>For your sake I am sorry that my condition should cause you
anxiety, for you have enough of that, God knows. But I am so well
this time that I hope and trust all may go well, though one is
never sure. It is this conviction which I always have, and which
makes me serious and thoughtful, as who can know whether with the
termination of this time my life may not also terminate?</p>

<p>This is also one of the reasons why I long so very much to see you,
my own precious Mama, this summer, for I cling to you with a love
and gratitude, the depth of which I know I can never find words or
means to express. After a year’s absence I wish so intensely to
behold your dear, sweet, loving face again, and to press my lips on
your dear hands. The older I grow the more I value and appreciate
that mother’s love which is unique in the world; and having, since
darling Papa’s death, only you, the love to my parents and to
adored Papa’s memory is all centred in <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>Louis has leave from the 11th of June to the 11th of August.</p>

<p>Uncle Ernest is coming here to-day for the day, from Frankfort,
where he has been to a cattle-show. Uncle Adalbert is here, so much
pleased with having seen you again, singing the praise of both
Lenchen and Louise, which of course I joined in, as it is such a
pleasure to hear others admire and appreciate my dear sisters.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, May 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>I know you will be grieved to hear that we all<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span> have had the grief
of losing good, excellent Jäger.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He was, on the whole, better
and was out daily, and he went to bed as usual, when in the middle
of the night he called one of the men, and before they could come
to his assistance he expired, having broken a blood-vessel. Poor
Katrinchen’s despair and grief were quite heart-rending, when we
went together to see our true and valued servant for the last time.
I was so upset by the whole, that it was some days before I got
over it. We made wreaths to put on his coffin, which was covered
with flowers sent from all sides, and we both were at the door with
our servants when he was carried out, and tried to console the
poor, unfortunate <i>Braut</i> [bride], who remained at home.</p>

<p>He was the best servant one could find; never, since he has been in
our service, had he been found fault with by any one. He was good,
pious, and gentle, and very intelligent. The death of a good man,
who has fulfilled his allotted duty in this world as a good
Christian ought, touches one deeply, and we have really mourned for
him as for a friend, for he was one in the true sense of the word.
Jäger rests alongside my poor Willem, in the pretty little cemetery
here; a bit of my heart went with them.</p>

<p>Fritz, on his way back from Italy, spent a few hours with us, and
told us much of his journey. He heard the strangest rumors of
France intending to break out in sudden hostilities with Germany,
and asked me what you thought of a probability of a war for this
summer. I hope to God, that nothing horrid of that sort will
happen! Do you think it likely, dear Mama?</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">{209}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, May 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>My own darling and most precious Mama, the warmest and tenderest
wishes that grateful children can form for a beloved parent we both
form for you, and these lines but weakly express all I would like
to say. May God bless and watch over a life so precious and so dear
to many! It is now six years since I spent that dear day near you,
but I hope that some time or other we shall be allowed to do so.
Our joint present is a medal for you with our heads. We had it made
large in oxidized silver on purpose for you. I myself have braided
and embroidered, with Christa’s help (who begged to be allowed to
do something for you), a trimming for a dress, which I hope you
will like and wear. It took a deal of my time, and my thoughts were
so much with you while I was doing it, that I quite regretted its
completion.</p>

<p>We are having a bracelet with our miniatures and the three
children’s in it made for you, but unfortunately it is not
finished, so we shall bring it and give it to you ourselves.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, May 29th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The intense heat remains the same, and becomes daily less
endurable here in town&mdash;the result on my unfortunate person being a
very painful rash which itches beyond all description. I hope it
won’t increase.</p>

<p>How I envy you at Balmoral! the very thought of that air makes me
better.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Osborne</span>, August 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>I was just sitting down to write to you when Ernest came in with
your dear letter. Thousand thanks for it! These parting lines will
be such a clear companion to me on our journey. I can’t tell you
how much I felt taking leave of you this time, dear Mama;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">{210}</a></span> it
always is such a wrench to tear myself away from you and my home
again. Where I have so, oh, so much to be thankful and grateful to
you for, I always fear that I can never express my thanks as warmly
as I feel them, which I do indeed from the bottom of my heart. God
bless you, darling Mama, for all your love and kindness; and from
the depth of my heart do I pray that nothing may cause you such
anxiety and sorrow again as you have had to bear of late. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>When I left you at the pier the return to the empty house was so
sad! It felt quite strange, and by no means pleasant, to be here
without you and all the others. We lunched alone with Victoria, and
dined in the hot dining-room with the ladies and gentlemen, sitting
on the terrace afterward.</p>

<p>It has rained all the morning, and is most oppressive. As it is so
foggy, we have to leave at two; but there is no wind, and I hope
the sea will be quite smooth. I am sure you must feel lonely and
depressed on this journey, poor Mama; but the change of scene and
beautiful nature enjoyed in rest and quiet must surely do you good.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, August 10th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We left Osborne at two on Thursday in rain and wind. The
children and I were dreadfully sick an hour after starting, but the
passage got smoother later; and, though I was very wretched in
every way, I was not sick again. The same sort of weather on the
<i>Alberta</i> next morning, but it cleared up later. The Rhine steamer
was very comfortable, and Doctor Minter accompanied us to
Dordrecht. The last afternoon and night on board I suffered
dreadfully. Since I arrived here, I am better, but not right yet.
Had it not been for your great kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_211" id="page_211">{211}</a></span>ness in giving us the ship, I
am sure I should not have got home right. This awful heat adds to
my feelings of fatigue and discomfort.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, August 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>I have just received your letter, from Lucerne, and hasten to thank
you for it.</p>

<p>How glad I am that you admire the beautiful scenery, and that I
know it, and can share your admiration and enjoyment of it in
thought with you! It is most lovely. The splendid forms, and the
color of the lake, are two things that we don’t know in dear
Scotland, and which are so peculiar to Swiss scenery.</p>

<p>Louis is in town from eight till our two o’clock dinner, and has a
great deal to do.</p>

<p>For your sake as for my own I long for a respite from this
unbearable heat, which is so weakening and trying.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, August 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How satisfactory the accounts of dear good Arthur are! From
the depth of my heart do I congratulate you on all that Colonel
Elphinstone says about his character, for with a real moral
foundation, and a strict sense of duty and of what is right and
wrong, he will have a power to combat the temptations of the world
and those within himself. I am sure that he will grow up to be a
pride and pleasure to you, and an honor to his country.</p>

<p>Brown must have been glad to be allowed to continue wearing his
kilt, and, as it is a national dress, it is far more natural that
he should give it up nowhere. I am sure that he and Annie<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> must
admire the place.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, August 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>I have just received your dear letter, and am so pleased to hear
that you enjoyed your excursion, and that you have now seen the
sort of wild scenery high up in the mountains, which I think so
beautiful and grand in Switzerland. For all admirers of that style
of scenery there is nothing to be compared to Switzerland.</p>

<p>Since it became cool again I have had neuralgia in my head, and I
have had a dreadful sty, which had to be cut open, and made me
quite faint and sick for the whole day. In spite of it I went to
the station here, with a thick veil on, to see the Russian
relations pass two days ago. The Emperor looks even more altered
and worn since last year, and is suddenly grown so old.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, September 4th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How too delightful your expeditions must have been! I do
rejoice that, through the change of weather, you should have been
able to see and enjoy all that glorious scenery. Without your good
ponies and Brown, etc., you would have felt how difficult such
ascents are for common mortals, particularly when the horses slip,
and finally sit down. I am sure all this will have done you good;
seeing such totally new beautiful scenery does refresh so
immensely, and the air and exertion&mdash;both of which you seem to bear
so well now&mdash;will do your health good.</p>

<p>Yesterday we both were two hours at Jugenheim. To-day the two
little cousins are coming to see my children.</p>

<p>Louis’ business is increasing daily, and until the 19th, manœuvres,
inspections, etc., won’t be over. He will even have to be away on
his birthday, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">{213}</a></span> is a great bore. There is a great review for
the Emperor on Saturday.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
September 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Like a foolish frightened creature as I am, I have worried
myself so much about this sudden talk of war and threatening in all
the French papers, saying that October, November, or thereabouts
would be a good time to begin. Do tell me, if you think there is
the least reasonable apprehension for any thing of that sort this
year. I have such confidence in your opinion, and you can imagine
how in my present condition I must tremble before a recurrence of
all I went through in 1866!</p>

<p>I am so grieved that you should be so unwell on the journey home.
Dear beautiful Scotland will do you good. I envy your going there,
and wish I could be with you, for I am so fond of it. Remember me
to all the good people.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 28th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The Queen of Prussia is coming to lunch with us on Saturday
on her way to Coblenz.</p>

<p>I have a cold these last days, and Victoria is still confined to
the house with her swelled neck. She had quite lost her appetite,
and I tried some porridge for her, which she enjoys, and I hope it
will fatten her up a little, for she is so thin and pale. Would you
please order a small barrel of oatmeal to be sent to me? Dr. Weber
thinks it would be very good for Victoria, and one cannot get it
here.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

<p>It is with the greatest interest that I read about the
Mausoleum,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> as I was very anxious to know whether all would be
finished. Having been present before<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214">{214}</a></span> at all the important steps in
the progress of this undertaking, I feel very sorry to be absent at
the last, and I shall be very impatient to see it all again.</p>

<p>Winter has quite set in now here, and when there is no wind the
cold is very pleasant.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 4th.<br />
</p>

<p>Thousand thanks for all your dear kind wishes, for your first
letter to me, for the one to Louis, and finally for the eatables! I
can’t tell you how touched, how pleased we both are at the kind
interest all at home have shown us on this occasion. It has really
enhanced our pleasure at the birth of our little son, to receive so
many marks of sympathy and attachment from those in my dear native
home, and in my present one. My heart is indeed overflowing with
gratitude for all God’s blessings.</p>

<p>The time itself was very severe, but my recovery is up to now the
best I have ever made, and I feel comparatively strong and well.</p>

<p>The girls are delighted with their brother, though Victoria was
sorry it was not a sister. Darling Louis was too overcome and taken
up with me at first to be half pleased enough. Baby is to be called
by Louis’ Uncle Louis’ wish, <i>Ernst Ludwig</i>, after a former
Landgrave;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> then we would like you to give the name <i>Albert</i>;
<i>Charles</i>, after my father-in-law; and <i>William</i>, after the King of
Prussia, whom we mean to ask to be godfather. The christening is
most likely to be on the 28th, or thereabout.</p>

<p>I am on my sofa in my sitting-room with all your dear photos, etc.,
around me, and your pretty quilt over me.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Every new event in my life renews<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span> the grief for dear Papa’s
loss, and the deep regret that he was not here to know of all, to
ask advice from, to share joy and grief with, for he was such a
tender father, and would have been such a loving grandfather.</p>

<p>You, darling Mama, fill his place with your own, and may God’s
support never leave you, and ever enable you to continue fulfilling
the many duties toward State and family! The love of your children
and people encircles you.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 18th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The presents you intend giving baby will delight us, and in
later years I can tell him all about his Grandpapa, and how I wish
and pray he may turn out in any way like him, and try and aim to
become so.</p>

<p>I think it would be best, perhaps, if you asked my mother-in-law to
represent you and hold baby. I think it would pain her, should any
one else do it, and I will ask her in your name, if you will kindly
telegraph me your approval.</p>

<p>I am sorry Arthur cannot come, it would have given us such pleasure
had it been possible.</p>

<p>The greater part of baby’s monthly gowns have been put away, as
from the beginning they were too small. He is so very big.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
Christmas Day.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Louis thanks you thousand times, as we do, for the charming
presents for the children. They showed them to every one, shouting:
“This is from my dear English Grandmama”; and Ella, who is always
sentimental, added: “She is so very good, my Grandmama.” Irene
could not be parted from the doll you gave her, nor Victoria from
hers. Baby was brought down, and was wide awake the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">{216}</a></span> time,
looking about with his little bright eyes like a much older child.</p>

<p>We spent a very happy Christmas eve, surrounded by the dear
children and our kind relations.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 29th.<br />

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Prince Hohenzollern with three gentlemen were sent by the
King, and the former dined with us after the ceremony. All went off
so well, and baby, who is in every way like a child of two months,
looked about him quite wisely, and was much admired by all who saw
him.</p>

<p>I am so sorry that you have never seen my babies since Victoria,
for I know you would admire them, they look so mottled and healthy.
Weather permitting, baby is to be photographed to-morrow.</p></div>

<h3><a name="yr-1869" id="yr-1869">1869</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter passed quickly and quietly amidst many occupations.</p>

<p>In May the Prince and Princess, with their children, went on a visit to
the Crown Prince and Princess of Prussia at Potsdam, where they spent
four happy weeks. Whilst they were there, the Viceroy of Egypt paid a
visit to Berlin. Later in the summer they went to Silesia, and spent
some time at Fischbach, a property belonging to Princess Charles of
Hesse, whose sister, the Queen of Bavaria, and brother, Prince Adalbert
of Prussia, joined them there. During their stay, the Prince and
Princess made excursions into the neighboring<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217" id="page_217">{217}</a></span> mountains, and ascended
the Schneekoppe; and the Prince and his brothers visited the battlefield
of Königsgrätz. On the way back to Darmstadt they visited Dresden, to
see the King and Queen of Saxony at their country seat, Pillnitz, an
hour’s drive from Dresden.</p>

<p>In August, the King of Prussia for the first time personally inspected
the Hessian troops. The Prince commanded the troops at the manœuvres in
Upper Hesse, at the conclusion of which they paraded before the King of
Prussia at Bergen.</p>

<p>Some weeks later, the Prince and Princess of Wales and their family paid
Prince and Princess Louis a visit at Kranichstein. The opening of the
Idiot Asylum built by the Princess took place on the 15th of October in
her presence and that of the Prince. It had been arranged that Prince
Louis should accompany the Crown Prince of Prussia on his journey to the
East, on the occasion of the opening of the Suez Canal. He started on
the 9th of October for Venice. The two Princes visited Corfu, Athens,
and Constantinople, and were received with every possible honor in the
capitals of Greece and Turkey. They went on to Jaffa, and thence to
Jerusalem, Hebron, Damascus, and Baalbec, and finally, on the 15th of
November, they arrived at Port Said, where they met a large number of
other Princes. A journey up the Nile as far as the first and second
cataracts brought their travels to an end. They returned home by way of
Naples, and through Italy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span></p>

<p>During the absence of the two Princes, the Crown Princess of Prussia and
Princess Alice, with her little son, went to Cannes. Whilst there, the
Princess devoted herself entirely to the care of her child. Being
together with her sister, and in that sunny country, made up somewhat
for the long separation from her husband. The Princes joined the two
Princesses at Cannes shortly before Christmas. The new year saw them all
at home again.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, January 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Dear charming Lady Frances [Baillie] is on a visit with us,
and I enjoy having her so much. We talk of old times at Frogmore,
and so many pleasant recollections.</p>

<p>I am glad that you like baby’s photograph, though it does not do
him justice. He is a pretty baby on the whole, and has a beautiful
skin, very large eyes, and pretty mouth and chin; but his nose is
not very pretty, as it is so short at present. He is a dear good
child, and, though immensely lively, does not give much trouble. He
is a great source of happiness to us, and I trust will continue so.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Is not the death of Leopold’s son shocking?<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Such
suffering, such a struggle for months between life and death; and
for the poor parents to have in the end to relinquish their child,
their only son! I think it heart-rending. May the Almighty continue
to support them even now, as he did these many months! I cannot say
how much and truly I feel for them both. This world is full of
trials, and some seem to be called upon to suffer and give up so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_219" id="page_219">{219}</a></span>
much. Faith and resignation alone can save those hearts from
breaking, when the burden must be so heavy.</p>

<p>A few days ago at two o’clock we had another shock [of earthquake],
and it seemed as if the house rocked; at the same time the
unearthly noise. I think it uncommonly unpleasant, particularly
this repetition.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>Our thoughts and prayers are so much with you and dear Leopold on
this day [his Confirmation]. May the Almighty bless and protect
that precious boy, and give him health and strength to continue a
life so well begun and so full of promise!</p>

<p>It seems to me quite incredible, the eighth of us should already be
old enough to take this step in life, and to have his childhood in
fact behind him. Dear Papa’s blessing surely rests on him, and his
spirit is near you as you stand there alone by the side of his
child, about whom he always was so anxious.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Beloved Papa’s cast arrived a few days ago, and stands in my
bedroom. I think it very beautiful, and thank you so warmly for
having sent it me.</p>

<p>Poor Orchard, whose leg is very painful and swelled, is to go to
bed for a week for entire rest of the limb. You can imagine how
inconvenient this is, as we have only Emma and Kathrinchen for the
others and baby. You will be amused when I tell you that old
Amelung is coming to sleep with baby, and take charge of him; but
she is too old and out of practice to be able to wash and dress him
morning and evening besides, so I do that, and it is of course a
great assistance to all, my being able to do it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span> I don’t mind
the trouble. Of a morning, as Louis is usually out riding or at his
office, I take Victoria and Ella out, who are very good little
girls and very amusing.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, March 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We shall go to Potsdam the first week in May, and from there
go for a week or ten days to Fischbach. My mother-in-law, Tante
Mariechen, and Uncle Adalbert, are all going to spend my
mother-in-law’s birthday there.</p>

<p>The Moriers are going to England in the first days of April, and I
hope that you will see them. We see a good deal of them, and like
them both much. He is wonderfully clever and learned, and takes
interest in every thing; and she is very agreeable, and a most
satisfied, amiable disposition&mdash;always contented and amused.</p></div>

</p>

<p>I thought of you so much on the 16th. From that day dated the
commencement of so much grief and sorrow; yet in those days you had
<i>one</i>, darling Mama, whose first thought and deepest was to comfort
and help you, and I saw and understood only then <i>how</i> he watched
over you, and how and everywhere he sought to ward off all that was
painful and strange from you, and took all that pain alone for
himself for your sake! I see his dear face&mdash;so pale, and so full of
tears, when he led me to you early that morning after all was over
and said, “Comfort Mama,” as if those words were a <i>Vorbedeutung</i>
[presage] of what was to come. In those days I think he knew how
deep my love was for you, and that as long as I was left in my
home, my first and only thought should be you and you alone!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">{221}</a></span> This
I held as my holiest and dearest duty, until I had to leave you, my
beloved Mother, to form a home and family for myself, and new ties
which were to take up much of my heart and strength.</p>

<p>But that bond of love, though I can no more be near you, is as
strong as ever.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, March 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday it was very warm, and to-day it snows; the weather
continues so changeable and many people are ill. Ella has again had
one of her bad attacks in her throat, but, thank God, it passed
away very soon. Two nights ago she could not speak&mdash;barely
breathe&mdash;and was so uncomfortable, poor child. It makes one so
anxious each time; but I hope she will outgrow it, when she is six
or seven years old.</p>

<p>Victoria is already now composing a letter for your birthday. I
won’t have her helped, because I should like you to see her own
ideas and style&mdash;it is much more amusing.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We had such an unexpected pleasure the other day in the visit
of good General Seymour, and I was so pleased to see some one who
had seen you lately, and who could give me news of my home. He had
not been here since he came with us after our marriage, and was of
course interested in seeing every thing.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The constant anxiety about the children is dreadful; and it
is not physical ill one dreads for them, it is moral: the
responsibility for these little lent souls is great, and, indeed,
none can take it lightly who feel how great and important a
parent’s duty is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_222" id="page_222">{222}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, April 5th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Thousand thanks for your dear letter, and for all the tender
wishes for our dear child’s birthday! The child born under your
roof and your care is of course your particular one, and later, if
you wish to keep her at any time when we have been paying you a
visit, we shall gladly leave her.</p>

<p>Victoria is so delighted with what you sent her, and sends her very
warmest thanks and her tenderest love. She is in great beauty just
at present, as she is grown stouter; and I look with pleasure on
those two girls when they go out together. They possess, indeed,
all we could wish, and are full of promise. May the Almighty
protect them and give them a long life, to be of use and a joy to
their fellow-creatures!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Rain and wind have at length cooled the air, for this heat
without any shade was too unpleasant. Louis left at five this
morning to inspect the garrison at Friedberg and Giessen, and then
to go to Alsfeld to shoot <i>Auerhähne</i> [capercailzies]. He will
return on the 21st or 22d probably.</p>

<p>We shall indeed be so pleased, if later you wish to have any of the
granddaughters with you, to comply with any such wish, for I often
think so sadly for your dear sake, how lonely it must be when one
child after another grows up and leaves home; and even if they
remain, to have no children in the house is most dreary. Surely you
can never lack to have some from amongst the many grandchildren;
and there are none of us, who would not gladly have our children
live under the same roof where we passed such a happy childhood,
with such a loving Grandmama to take care of them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_223" id="page_223">{223}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
April 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;May I only know the way to give my children as much pleasure
and happiness as you have ever known to give me!</p>

<p>The dinner of family and suite is here in the house to-day&mdash;or
rather I should call it a luncheon, as it is at two o’clock.</p>

<p>The Irish Church question, I quite feel with you, will neither be
solved nor settled in this way; and instead of doing something
which would bring the Catholics more under the authority of the
State, they will, I fear, be the more powerful. It seems to me that
one injustice (with regard to the Protestants) is to be put in the
place of a former one, instead of doing justice to both, which
would not have been an impossibility through some well-considered
settlement and giving in on both sides. Such a <i>changement</i>
requires so much thought and wisdom, and, above all, impartiality.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 3d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;My children are, on the whole, very well behaved and
obedient, and, save by fits and starts, which don’t last long, very
manageable. I try to be very just and consistent in all things
toward them, but it is sometimes a great trial of patience, I own.
They are so forward, clever, and spirited, that the least spoiling
would do them great harm.</p>

<p>How glad I am that the dear Countess [Blücher] is with you again;
she is the pleasantest companion possible, and so dear and loving,
and she is devoted to you and dear Papa’s memory as never any one
was.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Potsdam</span>, May 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>How much we thought of you yesterday, I can’t say! Lord Augustus
Loftus lunched with us three<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">{224}</a></span> and the elder children; and we drank
your health, the band playing “God Save the Queen!” All our girls
had wreaths of natural flowers in honor of the day.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Potsdam</span>, June 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To-day is regular March weather, and the palace is cold and
draughty.</p>

<p>We were in Berlin yesterday, to visit the Gewerbe-Museum
[Industrial Museum]; then luncheon at Lord Augustus Loftus’, and
from thence to the Victoria bazaar and Victoria Stift, and then
home.</p>

<p>It is always so tiring to see things at Berlin; an hour’s rail
there and the same back takes so much time. Before returning, we
paid a short visit to Baron Stockmar and his wife, who is very
pleasing, and seems to suit him perfectly. They look as if they had
always belonged to each other.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Potsdam</span>, June 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>Our time here is soon drawing to a close, much to my regret; for
the life with dear Vicky&mdash;so quiet and pleasant&mdash;reminds me in many
things of our life in England in former happy days, and so much
that we had Vicky has copied for her children. Yet we both always
say to each other, no children were so happy, and so spoiled with
all the enjoyments and comforts children can wish for, as we were;
and that we can never (of course, still less I) give our children
all that we had. I am sure dear Papa and you, if you could ever
hear how often, how tenderly, Vicky and I talk of our most beloved
parents, and how grateful we are for what they did for us, would in
some measure feel repaid for all the trouble we gave, and all the
anxiety we caused. I ever look back to my childhood and girlhood as
the happiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225" id="page_225">{225}</a></span> time of my life. The responsibilities, and often the
want of many a thing, in married life can never give unalloyed
happiness.</p>

<p>We are looking for a governess for the two elder girls for next
year, and a lady with the necessary knowledge and character, and
yet of a certain rank, is so difficult to find.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Potsdam</span>, June 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>Louis went two days ago to Fischbach for his mother’s birthday, and
returns to-morrow morning. Vicky was very low yesterday; she has
been so for the last week, and she told me much of what an awful
time she went through in 1866, when dear Siggie [Sigismund] died.
The little chapel is very peaceful and cheerful, and full of
flowers. We go there <i>en passant</i> nearly daily, and it seems to
give dear Vicky pleasure to go there.</p>

<p>Vicky goes on the 7th of July to Norderney.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Fischbach Schlesien</span>, July 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>We arrived here in this exquisitely-lovely country two days ago,
and were received by our parents-in-law and Aunt Mariechen, whose
guests we are in the pretty old Castle of Fischbach, surrounded by
fine old trees, with a view on the beautiful Riesengebirge, which
reminds me a little of Scotland, and also of Switzerland. The
valleys are most lovely and the numberless wooded hills, before one
reaches the high mountains, are quite beautiful. The trees are
splendid and the country looks very rich and green.</p>

<p>All the people of the village and the neighborhood came out to see
us and our children, and old servants of Louis’ grandparents, who
were so delighted and pleased that I and my children should be
here, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226">{226}</a></span> that they should have lived to see the younger
generation.</p>

<p>We are out seeing the beautiful spots nearly all day long. The
weather is fine and not very warm, so that one can go about
comfortably. Yesterday we went over for tea to Erdmannsdorf. If
only dear Vicky and Fritz were there now! We must hope for another
year to be there together. The parting from them, who had made our
<i>séjour</i> under their hospitable roof such a very happy one, was
very sad, and the pouring rain was in accordance with our feelings.
We left them and dear lovely Potsdam and the pleasant life there
with much regret, and many a blessing do I send back in thought to
its dear inmates.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon we were at Schmiedeberg. We went to see a very
interesting carpet-manufactory, worked by hand, and all by girls,
and a very simple process, much like making fringe, which you used
to do and then make footstools of after Beatrice’s birth.</p>

<p>Yesterday our wedding-day&mdash;already seven years ago&mdash;made me think
so much of Osborne, and of you, darling Mama, and of all that
passed during that time. It was a quiet wedding in a time of much
sorrow, and I often think how trying it must have been for you.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, July 21st.<br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday after eighteen hours’ very hot railway journey, we
arrived here all well. Many thanks for your letter, which I
received at Dresden. It was impossible to write, as I had to pay
visits and to see things during those two days.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince and Princess received us at the station; the
following day we paid our visits. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_227" id="page_227">{227}</a></span> found Marie<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> in bed looking
very well, and her baby, tied up in a cushion, seemed a nice child.
Her other children are very pretty; the eldest girl is like George,
and the little one has a quantity of fair curls, like Louis of
Portugal’s boy. In the afternoon of that day the King and Queen
came to see us, and were very kind. She is very like the Queen
Dowager of Prussia, her twin sister, and her other sister, Queen
Marie, is very like her twin sister, Archduchess Sophie. As they
are first cousins, and very fond ones, of my father-in-law, they
consider themselves of course as our aunts.</p>

<p>I went to see the picture-gallery, which has some exquisite
pictures, though the Sistine Madonna surpasses all others, and the
famous Holbein, of which the Dresden gallery has been for long so
proud, is now recognized as a copy, and the one that belongs to my
mother-in-law as the original. We visited the <i>Grüne Gewöbel</i> [the
Green Vaults], where the magnificent jewels and other treasures are
preserved, and the King was kind enough to lead us over the rest of
the castle himself, including his own rooms, in one of which the
life-size pictures of his last four daughters (all dead) stand, of
whom he cannot speak without tears. How dreadfully he and the poor
Queen must have suffered these last years!</p>

<p>Uncle Louis is at Friedberg and intends remaining there all next
month, till the manœuvres are over. Alice Morier will accompany me.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, July 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>Thousand thanks for your kind letter which I received yesterday, at
the same time that the beautiful christening present for Ernest
arrived! Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_228" id="page_228">{228}</a></span>sand thanks for this most beautiful and precious gift
for our boy, from Louis and from myself! We are so pleased with it!
It is to be exhibited here, and it will interest and delight all
who see it, I am sure.</p>

<p>I have just received a letter from Bertie, announcing his arrival
here for the 28th. We shall be greatly pleased to see them all; but
we have so little room, and our house in town is all shut up and
under repair, so that we shall have some trouble to make them
comfortable and shall be quite unable to do it as we should wish.
But I trust they will be lenient and put up with what we can offer.</p>

<p>The heat is very great, though this place is comparatively cool.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, July 29th.<br />
</p>

<p>Dear Bertie and Alix with their children arrived at Darmstadt after
ten, and we brought them here by eleven o’clock last night. They
are all looking well, but Bertie has shaved off his beard, which
does not suit him. Dear Alix is unchanged, and certainly no fatter.</p>

<p>The children are very dear and pretty, but my boy is as tall as
little Louise, and of course much bigger. I am so delighted to see
them all again; it is such a great pleasure, as you can well
imagine.</p>

<p>The pony you kindly sent us has just arrived, and to the great
delight of all the children, who send their best thanks. We are all
lodged very close together: Bertie and Alix, our bedroom and my
dressing-room; we both, my sitting-room, and the passage-room; then
come the different children. No gentlemen or ladies are in the
house, as it was utterly impossible.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Victoria has often ridden on Dred, and also the other girls,
on a Spanish saddle, and he goes very well. They delight in him.
Baby rolls about the room anywhere now, and tries to crawl
properly. He calls Papa, and tries no end of things; he is very
forward, and is now cutting his fifth tooth, which is all but
through.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Friedberg</span>, August 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>On this dear day I must send you a few words. The weather is so
beautiful, and the sun so bright, as it used to be at Osborne in
former years. I don’t care for the sun to shine on this day now, as
it can’t shine on Him whose day it was. It makes one too
<i>wehmüthig</i> to think of darling Papa on those happy birthdays, and
it must be more so for you than for any of us, poor Mama.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Ludwigstag; all the town decorated with flags,
illuminations, etc., and English flags and arms with the Hessian
everywhere.</p>

<p>We started on horseback along the high road at half-past seven this
morning, and did not get off till one. A lovely country and very
interesting to see. To-morrow we shall have a very long march, and
the night Alice Morier, I and William (Louis is undecided) will
spend at Prince Ysenburg’s at Büdingen. The next morning we have to
ride off at half-past five, and a long day back here.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, September 11th.<br />

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;What charming expeditions you must have made in that lovely
country?<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> What I saw of it some years ago I admired so
intensely. You can well be proud of all the beauties of the
Highlands, which have so entirely their own stamp, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_230" id="page_230">{230}</a></span> no Alpine
scenery, however grand, can lessen one’s appreciation for that of
Scotland.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday we went to Mayence to see a
“<i>Gewerbe-Ausstellung</i>” [Industrial Exhibition] of the town, which
was very good and tastefully arranged. From there we went to
Frankfort to our palace, for a rendezvous with Aunt Cambridge,
Uncle George, Augusta and Fritz Strelitz. I showed them the
children, and afterwards, when our relations left, we took our
children to the Zoölogical Garden, which delighted them.</p>

<p>Many thanks for the grouse, which has just arrived, the first since
two years ago!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 3d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am very glad that you also approve of Louis’ journey, which
I know will be so useful and interesting for him, though it was not
possible to attain this without parting from each other, which is,
of course, no small trial for us, who are so unaccustomed to being
separated. But we never thought of that when we considered the plan
of Louis joining Fritz, which was my idea, as travelling in new
countries is so good for a man, and Louis may never find so good a
chance again. I am looking forward very much to seeing
Geneva&mdash;where we spend a day&mdash;and the south of France, and above
all, seeing the sea again. Fritz passes through here to-morrow.
Louis starts Saturday morning, <i>viâ</i> Munich, for Venice, where he
will join Fritz next Sunday afternoon, and spend the following
Monday there before they go to Brindisi. Vicky comes here with her
children on the 12th or 13th, and a suite of twenty-five people.
She goes on with the big boys to Baden, and I follow with the other
children on the following day. I don’t like separating Victoria
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_231" id="page_231">{231}</a></span> Ella, who like being together; the three girls will be so well
taken care of at their grandparents’. I have written down rules for
meals, going out, to bed, to lessons, etc.; and my mother-in-law,
who never interferes, will see that all is carried out as I wish. I
shall miss them so much, but having one child at least is a
comfort; and baby is beginning to talk, and is so funny and dear,
and so fond of me that he will be company to me when I am alone. I
take no one but Orchard, Eliza, Beck, and my <i>Haushofmeister</i>
[Steward], who used to be with Lord Granville.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at eleven we had the hard separation from each
other, which we both felt very much. My own dear, tender-hearted
Louis was quite in the state he was in when we parted at Windsor in
1860 after our engagement. He does not like leaving his children,
his home, and me, and really there are but few such husbands and
fathers as he. To possess a heart like his, and to call it my
<i>own</i>, I am ever prouder of and more grateful for from year to
year. Nowadays young men like Louis are rare enough, for it is
considered fine to neglect one’s wife, and for the wife also to
have amusements in which her husband does not share. We sisters are
singularly blessed in our husbands.</p>

<p>Dear kind Countess Blücher has been here the last two days&mdash;such a
happiness to me just now, for the house feels far too lonely.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Grand Hôtel</span>, <span class="smcap">Cannes</span>, November 5th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have this instant received another letter from dear Louis
from Constantinople, giving the accounts of what they did and saw
there until<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_232" id="page_232">{232}</a></span> the 29th ult., when they left for Jaffa. He seems
delighted, and very greatly interested with all he has seen. Louis
thought so much of the Sultan’s English visit in 1867, on seeing
him again. He found him more talkative than then. He saw also
several of the suite who were in England. They went to Scutari,
into the Black Sea, and visited all in and near Constantinople, and
on the last day they visited the Emperor of Austria, who had just
arrived. There is something very funny in hearing of these
Royalties, one after another, all running to the same places. They
must bore the Sultan considerably.</p>

<p>This journey will be of great advantage to dear Louis, who has
never had an opportunity (through marrying so young) of travelling
like others.</p>

<p>This afternoon we went to see poor Princess Waldeck. She is still
in great grief at the loss of her eldest daughter, who suffered so
long, and knew she was dying, and bore her lot with such
resignation and such goodness. She was only fifteen and a half, I
think.</p>

<p>I was very much pleased to see Lord and Lady Russell again the
other day. We hope to be able to pay them a visit at San Remo,
though one can’t go and return in the same day.</p>

<p>The country has looked too lovely to-day; the sunset is always most
beautiful, for it sets behind the Esterel Mountains, which lie to
the right from this bay, and have a very lovely jagged form.</p>

<p>I am reading to Vicky a new Life of Napoleon, by Lanfrey, which is
very well and impartially written.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The heavenly blue sea, stretching so far and wide, is in
accordance with one’s feelings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_233" id="page_233">{233}</a></span> and the beauties of nature have
always something comforting and soothing. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The Duke of Argyll’s sister, with his pretty daughter, Victoria,
are here, and we have been twice to see them, and are distressed
that they should be so anxious about the dear Duchess, of whom the
news to-day is worse. How dreadful, should any thing happen to her,
for her husband and for the many children!</p>

<p>The Eburys and Lord Dalhousie have likewise arrived here, but we
have not seen them yet.</p>

<p>To-morrow we had intended leaving this, but during the night poor
Vicky had the dreadful fright of Waldie’s being taken ill with the
croup. Thank God, he is better this morning, but our journey will
have to be put off for a few days, so that Vicky cannot now reach
Berlin in time for Christmas. As we don’t wish to spend that day
<i>en route</i>, we have telegraphed to our husbands, who reach Naples
to-day, to ask whether they will not join us here, that we may all
spend Christmas together before leaving.</p>

<p>This is all unsettled, and I will telegraph as soon as every thing
is definitely arranged. Rollet<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> is here to-day, and spends this
day in quiet with us.</p></div>

</p>

<p>We both had the happiness yesterday of receiving our dear husbands
safe and well here after so long a separation. They had been to
Naples and Pompeii, and Louis went for a day to Rome, so that he
has seen an enormous deal, which is very instructive for him, and
will be such a pleasure for him to look back upon in later years.</p>

<p>I am so glad that Louis has had the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234">{234}</a></span> of making this
journey; and it seems to have done his health good also, for he
looks very well.</p>

<p>The journey back is so long and difficult for me to manage alone
with Louis&mdash;as Vicky’s people, particularly in the nursery, have
helped mine&mdash;that I am obliged to wait until the 26th, and to go
with Vicky and Fritz, for they travel slower than I would do if I
went with Louis, who goes back direct day and night. The doctor
would not consent to my travelling with Ernie from this warm
climate into the great cold so fast, and during the night, for he
is cutting four back teeth at this moment.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday we visited Lord Dalhousie and Lady
Christian, and found him very gouty, but in good spirits. Lady
Ebury and Oggie<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> came to see us this afternoon. Prince and
Princess Frederic of the Netherlands and their daughter have
arrived here. The poor Princess is so weak, and looks like a
shadow.</p></div>

<p>Just as we were leaving Cannes your last letter reached me, for
which many thanks. It was cold the morning we left Cannes, very
cold at Avignon, where we spent the night, and still colder, and
snow and frost, on reaching this place yesterday evening. We and
the children are all well, and the poor little ones are very good
on the journey, considering all things. In an hour we leave for
Paris, rest there to-morrow, and then go to Cologne, where I shall
take leave of dear Vicky and Fritz, and go straight home. I have
been so much with dear Vicky this year, that the thought of parting
from her costs me a great pang, the more so as I do not think it
likely that I shall meet her in this new year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span></p>

<p>On New Year’s eve I arrange a Christmas-tree for all my children,
and in advance I thank you for all the presents you have been kind
enough to send us, and which we shall find at Darmstadt. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<h3><a name="yr-1870" id="yr-1870">1870</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the beginning of this year, and soon after his return from the East,
Prince Louis was laid up with scarlet-fever, and, soon after, Princess
Victoria and the little Prince took the same illness. Though the attack
was a severe one, all made a good recovery, and no ill effects remained
behind. Princess Alice undertook the nursing entirely herself. During
this time of enforced seclusion from the social world her intercourse
with the famous writer and theologian, David Friedrich Strauss, was a
source to her of great interest and enjoyment.</p>

<p>The Princess became acquainted with this remarkable man in the autumn of
1868 at her own particular desire, and after considerable hesitation on
his part. Strauss had spent the winter of 1866 at Darmstadt. He returned
there again in the spring of 1868, and remained there until the autumn
of 1872. His own account of his acquaintance with the Princess was by
her wish not published at the time, but has been since, with the consent
of his family and that of the Grand Duke. From this the following
narrative is taken almost verbatim:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>“Although I was entirely unaccustomed to associate with persons of
high rank, I soon felt entirely at ease with this lady. Her
simplicity, the kind manner in which she met me, and her keen
bright intellect made me forget all differences of social
position.”</p></div>

<p>Strauss visited the Princess very often, and their conversations lasted
sometimes for hours. He himself speaks of them as “most delightful and
refreshing.”</p>

<p>Very often they read aloud, and this no doubt led to a suggestion from
Strauss, that he should write down notes about Voltaire&mdash;whose works
they were studying&mdash;and afterward read them to the Princess. She entered
readily into this plan. “Her idea was to have a select circle of
listeners. Besides herself and one of her ladies, with whom she was very
intimate, Prince Louis, and the English Minister then at Darmstadt, Mr.
[now Sir Robert] Morier, were to be present.” The illness of Prince
Louis prevented this plan from being carried out.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“She, however, asked me,” Strauss writes, “to come and see her, if
I was not afraid of infection. She said that the next few weeks
would be very solitary ones, and it would be of great value to her
if I felt disposed to put up with her as sole audience for my
lectures on Voltaire. To this I was only too willing to agree.”</p></div>

<p>The manuscript took the form of seven lectures, and the author was
rewarded for his pains “by the keen interest and unwavering attention of
his listener.”</p>

<p>After repeated revisions, the printing of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span> on Voltaire began.
Strauss gives his own account of this in the following extract:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“When it first occurred to me to write something on Voltaire for
the Princess in the form of lectures, I naturally cherished the
hope that, when the little book was printed, I might obtain her
permission to dedicate it to her. As the work progressed, however,
this hope became fainter, and by the time the book was ready I had
entirely given it up.</p>

<p>“I could only take pleasure in my work, if I felt I had been
perfectly sincere; if, instead of condemning Voltaire, as is
usually the case, I stood up for him upon essential points&mdash;nay,
even went so far as to intimate that here and there he had seemed
to me not to have gone far enough.</p>

<p>“The Princess might naturally have scruples about allowing a book
of such a tendency to be dedicated to her, considering her position
and what was due to it; and to ask her to allow the book to be
dedicated to her seemed forbidden by that discretion which I was
bound to observe. The thought then struck me of writing with my own
hand into the copy of the book which I gave her the Dedication, in
the terms in which it now stands printed on the second page of the
volume. Meanwhile, on the one hand, the friendly intercourse with
the Princess continued, whilst on the other the printing of the
book advanced. One day in the most kind manner she told me how much
she felt she owed to our acquaintance, and how much it had helped
to clear her views in many ways. I, on my part, expressed to her in
all sincerity the animating and exhilarating influence which our
intercourse had exercised upon myself, and, in particular, how it
had cheered and encouraged me in my labors on Voltaire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span></p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>It would be nice, if you would dedicate your book to me,’ the
Princess rejoined. How agreeably surprised I was can easily be
imagined. I acknowledged without hesitation how this had been my
first intention, but that I had given it up out of regard for her,
not wishing to expose her to misinterpretation. The Princess
replied that the fear of being misunderstood would never prevent
her from doing what she thought right. I pointed out, that the
matter must be well and carefully considered, and that, first and
foremost, she must obtain her husband’s consent. Her answer was
that she had no fear on that point; but that she would of course
consult him about it. I told the Princess that I had made several
changes and additions since I first wrote the lectures. I would
therefore bring her the proof-sheets as soon as they were ready,
partly that she might glance over the whole again, and partly that
she might draw the Prince’s attention to any doubtful passages.
They would then be able to form their own opinions.</p>

<p>“I sent her the proof-sheets, and received them back from the
Princess on the 11th of June, 1870, with the following letter:</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span><span class="smcap">Dear Herr Professor</span>:&mdash;I return you your “Voltaire” with many
thanks. My husband read through the fifth chapter of it yesterday;
he does not think that its contents are such as to justify my
refusing the dedication. The value which I place on the dedication
of your book will always be far greater than any little
unpleasantness which might possibly arise from my accepting it.</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Alice.</span>’<br />
</p></div>

<p>“The dedication was thus unqualifiedly accepted, but now&mdash;in what words
should I put it? I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_239" id="page_239">{239}</a></span> got accustomed to the form in which I had meant
to write it myself into the copy I wished to present to the Princess. I
intended saying that I had written lectures for the Princess, and that
she had allowed me to read them aloud to her. Would not this make the
Princess, so to speak, an accomplice of this objectionable book? Could I
state this publicly? I felt myself bound to leave to the Princess the
choice between this dedication and a more formal one, in which these
allusions were omitted. Upon this the Princess sent me the following
answer:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I should not like any change made in what you have written on the
first page, and am greatly touched at your kind dedication.</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Alice.</span>’<br />
</p></div>

<p>“When I was at last able to send her my book in its complete form with
the dedication printed, I received the following note from her, written
from Kranichstein, on the 27th of June, 1870:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I have not been able till to-day to thank you for your “Voltaire”
received yesterday. The book itself is the cause of the delay, as I
devoted my spare time to reading over what you had yourself read to
me so beautifully last winter. I seemed to hear your voice and all
your observations again. I must thank you once more for that great
enjoyment, and for the kind terms of your dedication.</p>

<p class="r">
“<span class="lftspc">‘</span><span class="smcap">Alice.</span>’<br />
</p>

<p>“Seldom have the negotiations about the dedication of a book been
carried on in a way like this, and seldom has a Royal Princess
shown herself so courageous and amiable.”</p></div>

<p>All must agree in this opinion, from whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240" id="page_240">{240}</a></span> point of view they look
at the subject. It was like the Princess’ straightforward nature boldly
to acknowledge to the world her friendship for Strauss, even at the risk
of incurring the most unfavorable criticisms.</p>

<p>Strauss says, further, in his “Memoirs”:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“The memory of the Princess Alice will be inseparably connected, as
long as I live, with one of the most gratifying episodes of my
life&mdash;the writing of my work on Voltaire.”</p></div>

<p>To this must be added that though, as time went on, the Princess agreed
less and less with Strauss’ avowed religious views, and especially
differed considerably from those enunciated in his book, “The Old and
the New Faith,” she never thought otherwise of Strauss than with
gratitude and esteem, as one in whom she had met with the most beautiful
characteristics of the best German scholarship&mdash;viz., unflinching
sincerity, combined with a rare gift of saying what it has to say
clearly and pleasantly, and a winning modesty of personal demeanor.</p>

<p>In the end of March the Prince and Princess with their family went to
Mayence for change of air after the scarlet-fever. The Princess went
much into society during her stay there; but this did not prevent her
from making use of every possible opportunity for furthering those
institutions which she had so much at heart. She visited the hospitals
at Mayence, Offenbach, and Giessen, and had many consultations with the
heads of these various hospitals with a view to possible improvements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_241" id="page_241">{241}</a></span></p>

<p>The quiet, happy time at Kranichstein during the summer was suddenly
brought to an end by the declaration of war between France and Germany.
Prince Louis had to go to the front with his division, which, together
with another division, formed the Ninth Army Corps, and part of the
Second Army, commanded by Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia. The
Princess took leave of her husband on the 25th of July. She, however,
saw him again once or twice before the final leave-taking, on the 1st of
August.</p>

<p>On the 15th of August the Hessian division for the first time
encountered the enemy, before Metz, and on the 16th took part in the
battle of Mars-la-Tour. During the terrible battle of Gravelotte, on the
18th of August, Prince Louis and his division occupied a central
position in the irresistible force, which drove Marshal Bazaine back
into Metz, and held him imprisoned there with an iron grasp.</p>

<p>On the 19th Prince Louis and the troops encamped on the battlefield, and
he had the pleasure of meeting his brother Henry. Prince Louis took part
in the battle of Noisseville on the 31st of August, when General
Manteuffel commanded the troops engaged. He and his division also formed
part of the army investing Metz, partly doing outpost duty, and partly
serving in the reserve.</p>

<p>On the 8th of October, whilst the Prince was in command of his division
at Gravelotte, where the troops were concentrated in hourly expectation
of a sortie of the French from Metz, he received the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242">{242}</a></span> news of the birth
of a second son, who had been born on the 7th.</p>

<p>Ever since the Prince’s departure the Princess had remained “at her
post” in Darmstadt, helping, comforting, and advising all around her.
She was proud to be the wife of a German officer serving in the field in
such a cause, though her life for the present was full of anxiety and
care. She worked, like any other woman, to alleviate as best she could
the sufferings of the sick and the wounded, and giving aid to those who
were plunged into destitution by the war. Whilst she was living with her
children at Kranichstein the “<i>Hülfsverein</i>,” or Committee of Aid, had
its headquarters in her palace at Darmstadt. She herself went there
every day, visited all the hospitals, also the ambulances at the railway
station, and superintended the organization of “Committees of Aid” all
over the country. The Committees which she had organized long previously
now proved themselves an untold blessing.</p>

<p>The “Alice Society for Aid to Sick and Wounded” had sixteen trained
nurses ready for work at the beginning of the war. Through the voluntary
help of some of the best doctors and surgeons, who arranged classes at
different places for the instruction of all those who were anxious to
help to nurse during the war, the number of nurses was increased by
degrees to one hundred and sixty-four. These were sent to the different
hospitals in Hesse, to ambulances near Metz, to the hospital trains, and
the hospitals on the steamers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243">{243}</a></span></p>

<p>In her own palace the Princess arranged a depot for all necessaries
required for the sick and wounded. Later on another was established in
the Grand Ducal palace. Besides the many regular nurses, a number of
women and ladies joined together to serve out refreshments, during the
night as well as the daytime, to the wounded, who were constantly
passing through Darmstadt and halted at the railway station. Similar
committees were, thanks to the Princess’ own initiative, formed all over
the country.</p>

<p>One of the hospitals at Darmstadt, erected by the English National Red
Cross Society, and supplied with English surgeons, received the name of
“The Alice Hospital.” Under a special arrangement it was subsequently
taken over by the Hessian military authorities. In this hospital, as in
others established independently of the “Alice Society,” women and girls
of all classes lent their aid.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the aid to the sick and wounded, those who had been
rendered widows, orphans, or destitute by the war were cared for through
the Princess’ exertions; and “The Alice Society for the Education and
Employment of Women” did good service. Out of this Society sprang the
“Alice Lyceum,” which was intended for the intellectual culture of women
of the higher classes. Lectures were to be delivered in it on all the
interesting subjects of the day. This Lyceum continued for some years to
attract a more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244">{244}</a></span> numerous audience. In the first winter of its
existence lectures on English and German Literature, the History of Art,
German History, and Natural History were given. The lady at the head of
it was Fräulein Louise Büchner. Its subsequent failure was caused by
numerous external difficulties, and not because the original idea for
which it had been founded had proved otherwise than sound.</p>

<p>The little new-born Prince continued to thrive, and the Princess made a
comparatively quick recovery. The Crown Princess of Prussia, who was
then living at Homburg, came constantly to see her sister; and later on,
in November, they went together to Berlin. The christening of the little
Prince, who was to bear the name of the victorious general of
Weissenburg and Wörth, was deferred till his father’s return.</p>

<p>Prince Louis had garrisoned Fort St. Privat on the 29th of October, and
saw the 173,000 French prisoners and Imperial Guard pass before Prince
Frederick Charles of Prussia.</p>

<p>On the 30th the troops marched farther into the interior of the country.
Troyes was reached on the 10th of November, a few days later
Fontainebleau, and soon after the troops confronted the “Army of the
Loire” at Toury. The battle of Orleans took place on the 3d and 4th of
December, and on the 5th the victorious troops made the entry into the
town. Part of the Hessian division moved along the left bank of the
Loire, and fought the engage<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_245" id="page_245">{245}</a></span>ment of Montlivault on the 9th of December;
the other part of it surprised and took possession of the Castle of
Chambord, with five guns and many prisoners. Blois was soon after taken;
and from the 10th of December till the 14th of February, 1871, the
headquarters were at Orleans. During the expedition against General
Chanzy the Hessian division alone guarded the line of the Loire from
Gien to Blois.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;My three girls have had fearful colds&mdash;Ella bronchitis, which
Ernie also took from her, and during twelve hours we were in the
very greatest anxiety about him; the difficulty of breathing and
his whole state caused great alarm. Thank God, he is now quite
convalescent; but those were hours of intense suffering for me, as
you can imagine. Weber is most attentive and most kind on such
occasions, and in such moments one is so dependent on the doctor.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Some very good lectures have been given here lately,
undertaken by a committee, which we are at the head of, and of
which Mr. Morier is a member. They have been a great success
hitherto, and we are going to one to-night by Kinkel, who in 1848
was a refugee in England, and is now a professor at Zürich.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 16th.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Mama</span>:&mdash;We are very grateful for your kind enquiries, and
for your letter received this morning. The violence of the fever
and the great pain in the throat have abated, and dear Louis is
going on favorably. The nights are not good as yet, and his head
pains him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span></p>

<p>I am cut off from all intercourse with any one in the house, on
account of the dear children; and I trust they may escape, for they
still cough, particularly Ella and Ernie. I see Christa when I am
out walking, not otherwise, as she comes in contact with the part
of the house where the children live. I read to Louis, and play to
him, as my sitting-room opens into the bedroom. I keep the rooms
well aired, and not hot, and at night I sleep on a sofa near his
bed. The first two nights were anxious ones, and I was up all night
alone with him; but now, thank God, all seems to be going well. * *
*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>I am happy to say that all is going on well. Louis has no more
fever, but his throat is still far from well; it has still the
character of diphtheria, though in a mild form&mdash;a sort of skin and
bits of blood come away when he coughs. He is a very good patient,
and I leave him very little alone save when I take my walks, which
in this high cold wind are very unpleasant. I hear Ella is still so
hoarse and coughs, and Victoria is not quite well. Orchard writes
to me every evening, and Dr. Weber sees them in the morning before
he comes downstairs.</p>

<p>This instant Weber tells me that Victoria has the scarlet-fever,
and I have just been up to see her. She suffers very much, poor
child; the fever is very high and the rash much out. It is too late
now to separate the others, and those who are not predisposed will
escape; but those who are inclined to take it have it in them by
this time.</p>

<p>It is a source of great anxiety. Orchard and Emma have never had
it. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>I was very glad to get your dear lines of the 22d,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247" id="page_247">{247}</a></span> full of
sympathy for me during this anxious time. Victoria’s fever has been
very high; and so much discomfort and pain, with a dreadful cough,
which she has had for the last six weeks. She is very low, and
cries every now and then from weakness, etc., but is a very good
patient, poor little one. Amelung comes every afternoon and sits
with her, and she is a great favorite with the children, as she
knows countless pretty stories.</p>

<p>Louis is not out of bed yet, on account of his throat, etc.; but he
is much better, though in this treacherous climate, which is so
proverbially bad for throats and lungs, I fear that even with the
greatest care there is a risk.</p>

<p>The other children are as yet well, though I don’t think Ella
looking well; she has still a cold, and is as hoarse as when I came
home. Ernie is all right again, and looks the best of them all. I
doubt their escaping, though it is quite possible, as they did not
take it when Victoria did. I keep the rooms fresh and continually
aired.</p>

<p>All the balls and parties are going on here now. Of course, I can
neither go anywhere nor receive any one, on account of the
infection. It is a wearisome time indeed, and being so much in sick
rooms and so little out begins to tell upon me. How kind of you to
send the books! Louis will be delighted. I have just read to him
Russell’s book of Bertie and Alix’s journey, and am now reading to
him a new Life of Napoleon, by Lanfrey, which is very well
written&mdash;more against than for Napoleon. Of course, newspapers and
the <i>Revue des Deux-Mondes</i> I read to him besides. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Though dear baby has had two bad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248">{248}</a></span> restless nights, yet I am
happy to say that he has the illness so slightly, with so little
fever or sore throat, that we are in great hopes it will get no
worse. He is cutting his back teeth just now, which is the worse
moment possible to be ill in.</p>

<p>Victoria looks very hollow-eyed, pale, and wretched, poor darling,
but is in good spirits now. The other two are as yet free. The
weather is most beautiful&mdash;frosty and clear,&mdash;and I have been
skating daily for the last six days, which does me much good, and
enables me to see people again. This afternoon I have a large party
on the ice at Kranichstein, and this is always a great amusement to
the young people. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday evening we had to give a large party here, half to
the military, and the other to the civil authorities and to the
Bürger [citizens]. It went off well; but the amount of speaking, as
one must speak to all, and the effort to remember who they all
were&mdash;they having been all presented at once&mdash;was no small
exertion. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

statuette&mdash;a little gem, which every one has been admiring this

and the colored photographs of the rooms&mdash;in short, all and any

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am proud of my two girls, for they are warm-hearted and
gifted, too, in appearance. Victoria’s facility in learning is
wonderful, and her lessons are her delight. Her English history and
reading she has learned from me. I give her a lesson daily, and
Bäuerlein<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> can tell you how much she has learned. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I read a great deal, chiefly history and deeper works; and I have
one or two very learned acquaintances with whom to read or to have
books recommended by.</p>

<p>My two committees always give me no end of work, and I have tried
to have many improvements made in the girls’ schools of the
different classes; and some of these things, by dint of a deal of
trouble, are prospering, and I hope in time to come will prove
their worth. There is a great deal to be done, and in the hospitals
I have been able to get some very necessary changes made. I tell
you all this, fancying it may perhaps interest you a little bit. *

<p>How grieved I am for your sake, above all, and for the poor Clarks
and ourselves, that dear kind Sir James, that true fatherly friend,
is no more!! Many thanks for your last letter, which tells me of
your last visit to him, which I am sure must be a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_250" id="page_250">{250}</a></span> comfort to
you. Oh! how sad to think how many are gone! And for you, dear
Mama, this is quite dreadful. I can’t say how I feel it for you!</p>

<p>Lord Clarendon’s death grieves me much also; and it was so sudden.
Alice Skelmersdale wrote to me in the greatest distress; he had
been a most loving father.</p>

<p>In the midst of life we are in death; and in our quiet and solitary
existence out here, where we see no one, all accords with sad and
serious feelings, which, amidst the many people and worry you live
in, must jar with such feelings and make you wish for solitude. The
accounts you give touch me so much. Many thanks for having written
so much about dear Sir James; it is of great value to me. Louis
begs me to say, how he shares the grief you all and we must feel at
such a loss.</p>

<p>What you say about the education of our girls I entirely agree
with, and I strive to bring them up totally free from pride of
their position, which is <i>nothing</i> save what their personal worth
can make it. I read it to the governess&mdash;who quite enters into all
my wishes on that subject&mdash;thinking how good it would be for her to
hear your opinion. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I feel so entirely as you do on the
difference of rank, and how all important it is for princes and
princesses to know that they are nothing better or above others,
save through their own merit; and that they have only the double
duty of living for others and of being an example&mdash;good and modest.
This I hope my children will grow up to.</p></div>

</p>

<p>When I returned home last night really heartbroken, after having
parted from my good and tenderly-loved Louis, I found your dear
sympathizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_251" id="page_251">{251}</a></span> words, and I thank you a thousand times for
them&mdash;they were a comfort and pleasure to me! I parted with dear
Louis late in the evening, on the high road outside the village in
which he was quartered for the night, and we looked back until
nothing more was to be seen of each other. May the Almighty watch
over his precious life, and bring him safe back again: all the pain
and anxiety are forgotten and willingly borne if he is only left to
me and to his children!</p>

<p>It is an awful time, and the provocation of a war such as this a
crime that will have to be answered for, and for which there can be
no justification. Everywhere troops and peasants are heard singing
“Die Wacht am Rhein” and “Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?” and
there is a feeling of unity and standing by each other, forgetting
all party quarrels, which makes one proud of the name of German.
All women feel ashamed of complaining, when father, husband, or son
goes, and so many as volunteers in the ranks. This war is felt to
be national, and that the King had no other course left him to
pursue with honor.</p>

<p>I must be in town by nine o’clock: so much rests on me, and there
are so many to help&mdash;the poor forsaken soldiers’ families amongst
others! I have seen that all is ready to receive the wounded, and
to send out help. I send out fourteen nurses for the Feld-Lazarethe
[field-hospitals].</p>

<p>How much I feel for you now, for I know how truly you must feel for
Germany; and <i>all</i> know that every good thing England does for
Germany, and every evil she wards off her, is owing to your wisdom
and experience, and to your true and just feelings. You would, I am
sure, be pleased to hear how universally this is recognized and
appreciated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_252" id="page_252">{252}</a></span></p>

<p>What would beloved Papa have thought of this war? The unity of
Germany, which it has brought about, would please him, but never
the shocking means!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
July 28th.<br />
</p>

<p>My darling Louis is at Worms, and Henry just in front of him. The
enthusiasm all along the Rhine is wonderful. They are all hopeful,
though knowing well what enormous sacrifices and struggles a
victory will cost.</p>

<p>I cannot leave this place until our troops should have&mdash;which God
prevent!&mdash;to retreat, and the French come! Now is the moment when a
panic might overcome the people; and I think it my duty to remain
at my post, as it gives the people courage and confidence. My
parents-in-law, who have their three sons out, would feel my
absence, and they have the first claim on me. I am in beloved
Louis’ home, and nearer to him, if I remain. Of course, with dear
Vicky I should personally be far better off. But Fritz is not much
exposed, and she has not that fearful anxiety to such an amount as
I have for dear Louis, who, as commander of only a division, must
be in the very midst of all. Day and night this thought is
uppermost in my mind. I hope and pray for the best, and bear what
is sent to me in common with so many others. Work is a
<i>Zerstreuung</i> [distraction], and I know dear Louis would prefer
knowing me here for the present, and that must be the first
consideration to determine my actions.</p>

<p>Louis is well, and, now the dreadful parting is over, I am sure in
better spirits, though work and anxiety weigh on him, poor love.</p>

<p>The children send their love. I am pretty well; able to do a great
deal; headache and sleeplessness are but natural at this moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_253" id="page_253">{253}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
August 5th.<br />
</p>

<p>Arrived in our house this morning, I was received with the news of
dear Fritz’ victory, and that 500 French prisoners had just passed
through here by rail. I know none of ours can have been engaged,
but we have not heard if there was an engagement elsewhere. The
excitement and anxiety are quite dreadful! Please God, my darling
is safe, and will pass safely through these dreadful dangers&mdash;and
our many dear friends and acquaintances also! I am always sending
off things for the wounded from our stores, and continue working
and collecting, and all are most patriotic and united. It is a
solemn and great time we live in, and there is something grand and
elevating in the unity of high and low throughout this great
nation, which makes one proud of belonging to it. If only all goes
on well!</p>

<p>I am very sleepless, and never without headache, but one has
neither time nor wish to think of one’s self. My own Louis’ safety
is the all-engrossing thought; and I know, beloved Mama, that you
love him truly, and share this anxiety with me. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>A few words by messenger. I have sent a letter by Kanné, who came
here yesterday, having seen dear Louis the day before, which was
the first direct news I have had from him. Yesterday morning he was
at Faulquemont. Poor General von Manstein (our Chef), when he
reached Saarbrück, found his son had been killed, and he had him
taken out of the general grave and buried in the churchyard. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
No less than forty French wounded I saw this morning in our
hospital, with some Turcos. Some can’t speak in any known language,
and the French dislike having these savages near them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_254" id="page_254">{254}</a></span> much as
we do; their physiognomies are horrid, and they steal and murder as
<i>Handwerk</i> [their vocation].</p>

<p>So much going about&mdash;for I go to Darmstadt at half-past eight, and
remain till half-past eleven, in the morning, and in the afternoon
from five till eight&mdash;is getting very fatiguing to me; but the
people have no time to come out here, and there is much to see to,
and many to speak with.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>I have tried to write as often as I could, but I have only two
hours to myself during the whole day, through driving in here twice
a day. Besides the large Hülfsverein for the “wounded and sick,”
which is in our palace, I have daily to visit the four hospitals.
There is very much to do; we are so near the seat of war. This
morning we got two large wagons ready and sent off for
Pont-à-Mousson, where they telegraph from the battlefield of the
16th they are in great want. My best nurses are out there; the
others are in three hospitals: two of them&mdash;military ones&mdash;were not
ready or organized when 150 wounded arrived a week ago. I have just
had a telegram from dear Louis; he is well, and I hope in a day or
two the least dangerously of the Hessian wounded will arrive.</p>

<p>Thank God, all goes on successfully; but, indeed, I hope I shall
not live to see another such war&mdash;it is too shocking by far. We
have over five hundred wounded; as soon as any are better, they are
sent north, and worse ones fill the beds&mdash;French and German
intermixed. I neither see nor smell any thing else but wounds! and
the first <i>Anblick</i> [sight], which sometimes one does not escape
meeting, is very shocking! It was very late last night before I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">{255}</a></span>
got home. I was stopped at one of the hospitals, as a poor soldier
had had sudden violent bleeding, and was all but dead, as the
doctor could not find the artery; but I sent my carriage for
another surgeon, and I am happy to say he lives and is recovering.</p>

<p>As Louis commands the whole of our little army, a great many things
concerning the troops come to me from all parts of the country, and
there is much to do&mdash;much more than in my present state is good for
me; but it can’t be helped.</p>

<p>I drive back to Kranichstein by one daily, and am here again before
five, so I hope you will kindly forgive my writing seldomer. Becker
is engrossed with his duties at the Hülfsverein; there is no other
gentleman with me, and I have the household to look after, besides.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>My telegram will have told you that dear Louis is until now safe.
On the 16th, in the evening, and on the 17th and 18th, our troops
were engaged, and yesterday evening late I drove to the station, to
speak to General Kehrer, our commandant, and received a telegram of
the last victory, near Metz&mdash;a battle of nine hours, very
bloody&mdash;no mention of names. The people, all excited, crowded round
my carriage, asked for news&mdash;which of our regiments had been under
fire? I could tell them nothing, but pacified them, begging them to
go to their homes&mdash;they should hear as soon as I had news. I drove
home with an aching heart, and passed a dreadful night of suspense.
At six this morning a telegram from Louis (19th); he and his two
brothers safe; our loss enormous&mdash;seventy officers out of one
division (ours is the 25th), and Oberlieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">{256}</a></span> Möller, a great
favorite, his adjutant since 1866, very badly wounded. I went at
once to Darmstadt to Louis’ parents. They were so overcome and
thankful to hear of the safety of their children. This continual
anxiety is fearful. Now to-day all the poor wives, mothers,
sisters, come to me for news of their relations; it is
heart-rending! We sent off two large wagon-loads to Pont-à-Mousson
again with provisions, bandages, and medicaments, and mattresses to
bring back all the wounded possible by rail. I went the round of
the hospital, to have all the convalescent Prussians and French
able to travel sent to their homes, so as to get room, and now we
can await the sad arrivals. Oh, if it would but end! the misery of
thousands is too awful!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, August 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>Many thanks for your dear words of the 20th. God knows, I have
suffered much, and the load of anxiety is great! But thousands of
Germans bear this load in unity together for their Fatherland, and
none murmur. Yesterday a poor woman came to me to ask me to help
her to get to the battlefield, to have the body of her only son
looked for and brought home; and she was so resigned and patient.</p>

<p>I see daily, in all classes, so much grief and suffering; so many
acquaintances and friends have fallen! It is heart-rending! I ought
to be <i>very proud</i> though, and I am so, too, to hear from the
mouths of so many wounded officers the loud praise of Louis’ great
bravery on the 16th and 18th. Always in front, encouraging his men
where the battle raged fiercest and the balls fell thickest. He was
near our troops, speaking to them, directing them, and right and
left of him they fell in masses. This lasted eight hours!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_257" id="page_257">{257}</a></span></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Hourly almost the trains brings in fresh wounded, and many
and shocking are the sights one sees. I only returned here by one,
having gone to town at half-past eight this morning, and have still
three hospitals for this afternoon.</p>

<p>My nurses reached the battlefield in time, and were of great use.
Louis telegraphed (yesterday’s date) from Auboué, between
Thionville and Metz, where they remain in bivouac. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is ten
days since Louis has been in a bed or under a roof. They have no
water (it is kept for the wounded), and little to eat, but he is
very well.</p>

<p>It is difficult to get news, and I can never send any that is not
mostly ten days old ere it reaches him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I had a telegram on the 25th from near Marengo, not far from
Metz&mdash;all well. Louis has not been in bed or under a roof since the
16th, and it rains incessantly. I hope they won’t all be ill. He
writes mostly on cards, on the hilt of his sword, sitting on a box.
They cook their own dinner, and on the 16th they were going to eat
it, when orders came to turn the French left wing and go into
battle. That night was awful, though the day of the 18th seems to
have been the bloodiest ever known. Our wounded all tell me so.</p>

<p>My dear parents-in-law bear up well; but when we three get together
we pour our hearts out to each other, and then tears which are full
of anxiety will flow.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, September 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>I went early to Homburg, as no trains go regularly now. I went by
road from Frankfort, and found dear Vicky well&mdash;her little baby
very pretty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_258" id="page_258">{258}</a></span> healthy-looking; the other dear children also
well.</p>

<p>How much we had to tell each other! How much to be proud of, and
how many friends and acquaintances to mourn over! The few hours we
had together flew by in no time, and at Frankfort the train was
unpunctual&mdash;outside Darmstadt it waited nearly an hour. At our
palace, where I arrived at ten in the evening, people who were
going to our <i>Haupquartier</i> [headquarters], were waiting. I
scribbled a few words to my dear Louis (the first since he received
the Iron Cross, a great distinction) and packed a few things for
him&mdash;tea, etc.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
September 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>Though I am still forbidden to use my eyes, I must send you a few
words of thanks for your dear letter and telegram. I had a violent
inflammation of eyes and throat, with two days strong fever and
neuralgia. I am recovering now, but feel the effects very much; my
eyes are still bad, and it has reduced my strength, which I require
so much. Dr. Weber has just lost his sister (whom he treated in her
confinement) from puerperal fever, and he told me he thought he
must have given it to her, from going to and fro to his wounded,
for <i>Lazarethfieber</i> [hospital fever] and that were so closely
akin. You can fancy that in Louis’ absence, and with the prospect
of being alone, without even a married experienced lady in the
house, this prospect frightened me. It is unhealthy at any time to
be for one’s confinement in a town full of hospitals with wounded,
and Weber could never give me as much attention as at another time,
and, should I be very ill, there is no authority to say any thing
about what had best be done. On that account your telegram was a
relief to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_259" id="page_259">{259}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
September 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Daily I hear the muffled drums of the funeral of some soldier
or officer being taken past my windows to his last resting-place.
How deeply I do feel for the poor parents and widows!</p>

<p>My children are very well, but have absolutely no place where they
can walk with safety from infection, for the mass of sick troops
who get out and stop near the <i>Exercirplatz</i> [drill-ground], and
the hospitals in town. The barrack at the foot of our garden
contains 1,200 French prisoners, and many of them ill. It is much
to be hoped that there will be soon an end to all these things. I
feel for the Emperor and Empress very much. What ungrateful, vain,
and untruthful people the French are! To expose Paris to a siege,
now their armies are beaten, which they think through fine speeches
and volunteers they can set right again.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
September 22d.<br />
</p>

<p>I received your letter through Kanné yesterday, and thank you many
times for it; also for the little shawls and sash for Ernie. Every
souvenir from dear Balmoral is a pleasure.</p>

<p>Good Dr. Hofmeister will be very welcome, and I know he is very
clever. Mrs. Clarke is sure to get on well with him, and an older
doctor just now, besides being an acquaintance of so many years, is
to me indeed a comfort. I shall be able also to hear of all at
home, and of so many things that interest me. Thousand thanks from
Louis and from myself for your sending him. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> long for peace&mdash;the army and the nation&mdash;and I think so great a
national war as this need not require part of the foes’ territory.
What little is necessary for the military frontier they must take;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_260" id="page_260">{260}</a></span>
but the union of Germany under one head is a far greater and finer
end to such a war than the annexation of land!</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;War is the greatest scourge this world knows, and that we may
not live to see it again, is my earnest prayer.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
October 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The children are all well, in spite of the bad air here. I
send them out driving of an afternoon, when I can best, having only
one coachman, as ours are with Louis. At present they can’t manage
it often. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
October 3d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Dr. Hofmeister is to both of us a source of real confidence
and comfort. I don’t think any one else would have been more
welcome to me just now, and he can write daily to Louis, and
letters go usually in two days now.</p>

<p>I go as little as possible to the hospital now, and, indeed, do
nothing imprudent, you can be sure. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 12th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The nerves of my forehead and eyes are still painful; and
from all sides I am again called upon to look after, settle, and
advise concerning many things. On that account Dr. Weber and my
mother-in-law insist on my leaving Darmstadt for a total change of
scene, etc., for three weeks. I have resisted as long as I could,
as I so much dislike going from home now (though I do not feel up
to the work, and yet cannot keep from doing it), but I have finally
given in, and accepted Vicky’s kind invitation to accompany her for
three weeks to Berlin. The journey is long and cold, but her
company when<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_261" id="page_261">{261}</a></span> we are both alone is a pleasure to me, and I shall
hear all news as directly there as here.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Last night I was much overcome. I had been sitting at the
bedside of one of my poor young friends, and he was gasping in a
too-distressing way. The father held his hand, the tears streaming
down his cheek, the son was trying to say “<i>Weine nicht, Papa</i>”
[“Don’t weep, Papa!”]. The poor old father, so proud of his good
and handsome child, is heart-broken, and they are touchingly united
and full of feeling for each other. I would give any thing to save
his life; but all efforts will, I fear, be in vain. Though I have
seen so many lately die hard deaths, and heard and seen the grief
of many heart-broken widows and mothers, it makes my heart bleed
anew in each fresh case, and curse the wickedness of war again and
again.</p>

<p>Poor baby can’t be christened yet, as my parents-in-law think Louis
would not like it during his absence, so I shall wait. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How I rejoice to hear that Leopold gains so much strength,
and that he can be about again as usual. Will you kindly tell him
in Louis’ name and mine (as I am still restricted in all writing
and reading) that we beg him to stand godfather to our little
son?<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Baby is so nice and fat now, and thrives very well. I
think you would admire him, his features are so pretty, and he is
so pink, and looks so wide-awake and intelligent. Ernie, who in
general is a rough boy, is most tender and gentle to his little
brother, and not jealous. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_262" id="page_262">{262}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Berlin</span>, December 5th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday Fieldmarshal Wrangel came to see me, and his words
were, “<i>Zu gratuliren dass Ihr Mann ein Held ist, und sich so
superb geschlagen hat</i>” [“Accept my congratulations that your
husband is a hero, and has fought so magnificently”]. I am very
proud of all this, but I am too much a woman not to long above all
things to have him safe home again.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The evenings Vicky and I spend alone together, talking, or
writing our letters. There is so much to speak of and think about,
of the present and the future, that it is to me a great comfort to
be with dear Vicky. It is nearly five months since Louis left, and
we lead such single existences that a sister is inexpressibly dear
when all closer intercourse is so wanting! There is so much,
beloved Mama, I should like to speak to you about. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The girls are quite well, and very happy with their grandparents.
The governess&mdash;who in the end did not suit for the children&mdash;as the
six months’ trial is over, will not remain, and I am looking for
another one.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 18th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The children and I bore the journey well, and it was not
cold. Parting from dear Vicky was a hard moment, and I shall feel
the loneliness here so much, and miss my dear good Louis more than
ever. The children are, of course, at such a time the greatest
blessing. There is so much to do for them, and to look after for
them; and mine are dear good children, and do not give over-much
trouble.</p>

<p>Letters I have again received speak of the amount of danger Louis
has again been daily exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_263" id="page_263">{263}</a></span> to, and how his personal courage and
daring have given the victory in many a fight. God protect him! I
live in fear and trembling for his precious life, and after I hear
of his being safe through one battle, I take it as a fresh present
from the Almighty, and breathe freer again, though the fear soon
enough gets the upper hand again.</p>

<p>I have asked Uncle Louis to allow his <i>Berichte</i> [reports] to be
copied for you. Louis has Köhler and another footman with him, that
is all&mdash;and two coachmen. He rides in all battles the horse you
gave him in 1866, which he rode during that campaign, and which is
quite invaluable. It would interest Colonel Maude to know this, as
he bought the horse. My nursery is in very good order, and they are
all invaluable in their way.</p>

<p>How is good Dr. Hoffmeister’s family? Please say many kind things
to him from me, and tell him that the baby is getting so nice and
fat, and is so healthy in spite of all troubles. Here is a
photograph of him, but not at all flattered. Please give Dr.
Hofmeister one of them!</p>

<p>I have this instant received a letter from Louis dated the 11th! I
will have an extract made for you, I think it might interest Bertie
to hear something of Louis, whom he can be proud to have as a
brother-in-law, for I hear his praises continually. He has been
throughout the war, as every other General has been, without a
carriage, etc., like other Princes, and has gained the respect and
devotion of his troops.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I hope for this last time, if we are spared and live to come
over together once more, we may have the joy of showing their dear
Grandmama the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_264" id="page_264">{264}</a></span> whole little band. Of course, no thoughts of plans
can be entertained, and I know, after so very long a separation,
Louis would not be willing again to part from his children.</p>

<p>My wounded were so pleased to see me again yesterday. Alas! many in
bed, and so ill still! My two in the house are much better, and the
one who during six weeks lay at death’s door is recovering. I have
seldom experienced so great a satisfaction as seeing this young man
recover, and the doctors say I have been the means of saving his
life.</p>

<p>The joy of the old parents will be very great. Since I left, there
are new widows, and fresh parents bereft of only children; it is a
most painful duty to go to them. But I know the comfort of sympathy
is the only one in deep grief.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>My warmest and tenderest thanks for your dear and loving letter,
with so many expressions of a mother’s love and sympathy, which do
my heart good, now that I feel so lonely and anxious. It seems too
great a happiness to think of, that of our being allowed to come
with our children to you, and to Scotland; and you know the
smallest corner is enough for us, who are by no means
particular&mdash;neither are our people. If I write this to Louis, it
will be something for him to look forward to, to cheer him and
reward him after so hard a time, which he bears so bravely and
uncomplainingly. This morning I have been at the Alice Hospital,
which is prospering. I have been taking my gifts for Christmas to
one hospital after another. Your two capes have delighted the poor
sufferers, and the one wounded for the second time is very bad,
alas! My wounded officer in the house is recovering, next<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265">{265}</a></span> to a
miracle. For the two wounded in the house, the children, our
household, and the children of our servants at the war, I arrange
Christmas-trees.</p>

<p>We grown-up ones of the family have given up keeping Christmas for
ourselves. We have too much to do for others, and my
parents-in-law, like me, feel the absence of the dear ones who are
always here for Christmas.</p>

<p>I am superintending Victoria and Ella’s letters to you, which have
not achieved the perfection wished for. As they are to be quite
their own, I hope you will excuse their arriving a little later.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 27th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Louis telegraphed on Christmas day from Orleans, where I had
sent Christa’s brother with a box of eatables and woollen things
for his people, and a tiny Christmas-tree with little lights for
the whole party. Louis has sent me a photograph of himself and
staff done at Orleans, and I have sent for a copy for you, as it is
very good. On Christmas day it was five months since Louis and the
troops left. The charming stockings you sent, I have sent off in
part to-day to Louis to give to his <i>Stabswache</i> [Staff-guard]; the
other things I divide among the wounded and sick.</p>

<p>My children are all well. The little one sits up, and, though not
very fat, is round and firm, with rosy cheeks and the brightest
eyes possible. He is very healthy and strong, and in fact the
prettiest of all my babies. The three girls are so grown,
particularly the two eldest, you would scarcely know them. They are
both very tall for their age. Victoria is the height of Vicky’s
Charlotte, and Ella not much less. They are thin, and a change of
air would be very beneficial.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_266" id="page_266">{266}</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="yr-1871" id="yr-1871">1871</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> christening of the little Prince took place quietly on the 11th of
February, the child receiving the names of Frederick William. The
sponsors were the Empress of Germany, the Crown Princess, Crown Prince,
Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia, and Princess Alice’s own brother,
Prince Leopold. The ceremony took place in the absence of Prince Louis,
who had been unable to get leave, although an armistice had been
concluded on the 28th of January, which it was hoped would be the
forerunner of peace.</p>

<p>On the 18th of March the King of Prussia, who had meanwhile become
Emperor of Germany, made his entry into Frankfort-on-the-Main, together
with his son and his whole staff. The Grand Duke of Hesse and the
members of his family received him there.</p>

<p>Prince Louis at last obtained ten days’ leave of absence, and arrived at
Darmstadt on the 21st of March. The parents of the Prince had gone to
meet him and his brother William a few stations beyond Darmstadt, whilst
the Princess Alice awaited her husband at the Darmstadt railway station.
The joy and thankfulness of that meeting can well be imagined. Darmstadt
was gaily decorated in honor of the Prince’s return; and he met with an
enthusiastic reception.</p>

<p>Prince and Princess Louis were present at Berlin on the 16th of June at
the triumphal entry of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267" id="page_267">{267}</a></span> German troops on the conclusion of the
peace. On the 21st of June the Prince entered Darmstadt at the head of
his Hessian division. In spite of pouring rain, the town presented a
most festive appearance. Later on the Prince and Princess and their
children went to Seeheim (near Darmstadt), where her brother, Prince
Alfred, visited them on his return from his three years’ voyage round
the world. The Prince and Princess of Wales also paid their sister a
visit; and Prince and Princess Louis saw much of their Russian
relations, who were then staying at Jugenheim.</p>

<p>In August, the family went to the seaside at Blankenberghe, where they
spent three weeks, and afterward went to London. They arrived at
Balmoral on the 13th of September, on a visit to the Queen, whom they
found suffering severely. They stayed with her till the 1st of November,
but the children, who had caught the whooping cough, were sent to London
sooner. Whilst at Sandringham, to which the Prince and Princess went on
their way back from Balmoral, in the middle of November, the Prince of
Wales was taken ill. Prince Louis had to return to Darmstadt, but the
Princess remained in England, and shared the anxieties of the very
dangerous and protracted illness of her brother, whom she helped to
nurse. It was the same terrible fever (typhoid) which, ten years before,
had ended the life of the beloved Prince Consort, and it was so severe
that the worst was feared. Prince Louis returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_268" id="page_268">{268}</a></span> to England on the very
day when the danger was greatest, but he also was able to share in the
joy and thankfulness when improvement set in upon the 14th of December.
He remained over Christmas, and returned to Darmstadt before the year
was at an end.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, January 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;In England people are, I fear, becoming unjust toward the
German troops. Such a long and bloody war must demoralize the best
army; and I only say, in such a position how would the French have
behaved? Many French officers say the same, and how greatly they
respect the German soldier. Hundreds of French officers and two
generals have broken their word of honor, and run away. I doubt,
whether <i>one</i> in the German army would do such a thing. The French
peasants, often women, murder our soldiers in their beds, and the
wounded they have used too horribly many a time. Is it a wonder,
then, when the men let a feeling of revenge lay hold of them? A
guerilla war is always horrid, and no words can say how all Germans
feel and deplore the present phase of the war! I hope and trust
that the end may not be far distant.</p>

<p>One of the poor wounded soldiers whom I gave your cape to is dying,
and the poor boy won’t part from it for an instant, and holds it
tight round himself.</p>

<p>Louis continues at Orleans, where they have entrenched themselves,
and await with impatience news from Paris which must be of great
influence for the continuation or ending of the war.</p>

<p>My days fly past. The children take much of my time&mdash;so, too, the
house, my two wounded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269" id="page_269">{269}</a></span> house, and the hospitals, to one of
which I go daily.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, January 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How kind of you to work something for Louis; he will wear it
with such pleasure. Prince Frederick Carl’s recent victories<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
and the fresh hosts of prisoners must help to bring the war to an
end. Germany does not wish to go on, but the French won’t see that
they are beaten, and they will have to accept the visitors, who
must increase in numbers the longer the French refuse to accede to
the German demands.</p>

<p>I am so low, so deeply grieved for the misery entailed on both
sides, and feel for the French so much. Our troops do not pillage
in the way described in English papers. I have read far worse
accounts of what the French soldiers and <i>francs-tireurs</i> do in
their French villages.</p>

<p>The poor soldier who had your cape is dead. He died with it round
him. I was with him in the afternoon, and he had tears in his eyes,
and was very low. In the night he died. This morning I was at the
station to give things to the wounded and sick who came through&mdash;a
sorry sight. This afternoon I am going to a poor soldier’s widow
who has just had twins. The distress on all sides is great. I help
where I can. Becker tears his hair. The two wounded in the house
cost so much. So does every thing else; but as long as I can,
through sparing on myself, help others, I must do it&mdash;though I
have, as things now are, nothing left.</p>

<p>I will get a head of Ernest done for your bracelet, and another
one, so that you may have something else of him. He is a
magnificent boy, but so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270">{270}</a></span> huge&mdash;such limbs! The baby is not at all
small, but near Ernest all the others look small.</p>

<p>He can’t speak properly yet, but he understands every thing, and
has a wonderful ear for music. He sings the “<i>Guten Kameraden</i>”
without a fault in the time, and is passionately fond of dancing,
which he also does in time.</p>

<p>Irène is growing fast also, but the two eldest are quite big girls;
it makes me feel old when I see them growing up to me so fast.
Victoria has a very enquiring mind, and is studious, and learns
easily and well. Since the middle of December I have been without a
governess.</p>

<p>To-morrow I go to Mayence to see poor Woldemar<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Holstein’s
sister. He is very bad, to the grief of all Mayence, and of all who
know him.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, January 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is pouring and thawing&mdash;most dismal&mdash;and my thoughts are
with our dear ones and our poor troops far away. Becker lost his
brother-in-law, who leaves a wife (Matilda, Becker’s sister) and
four little children. Each day fresh losses.</p>

<p>My little baby ought to be christened, but Louis and my
parents-in-law always hope that the end of hostilities is near, and
that Louis can then get leave. Baby’s blue eyes are beginning to
turn, and look almost as if they would be brown. Should dear
Grandmama’s and Grandpapa’s eyes come up again amongst some of the
grandchildren, how nice it would be!</p>

<p>I have but little news to give. I go about to the poor soldiers’
widows and wives&mdash;no end of them, with new-born babies, in the
greatest distress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_271" id="page_271">{271}</a></span></p>

<p>Yesterday I saw the mother of the poor young soldier who died. She
keeps your cape as a precious relic, as it had given him such great
pleasure.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
January 30th.<br />
</p>

<p>Your charming photograph and kind letter arrived this
morning&mdash;thousand thanks for both! How like the photograph, and how
pleasing! I am so glad to have it.</p>

<p>The armistice and capitulation of Paris are great events. The
people are out of their minds with joy&mdash;flags all over the town,
and the streets crowded.</p>

<p>I forgot to say in my last letter how grieved I was about Beaty
Durham’s<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> death. It is quite shocking! and those numbers of
children in so short a time. I earnestly hope none of us run such a
chance, for on the whole our children have not been so close
together. My last came sooner than I wished, and is smaller than
his brother, but I hope now for a long rest. I have baby fed,
besides, so as not to try my strength. He is very healthy and
strong, and is more like Victoria and my brothers and sisters than
my other children, and his eyes remind me of Uncle Ernest’s, and
seem turning brown, which would be very pretty, as he is very fair
otherwise.</p>

<p>Your pretty photograph is standing before me, and makes me quite
absent. I catch myself continually staring at it, instead of
writing my letters.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, February 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;All the many French here are pleased at the capitulation of
Paris, and hope that peace is certain. Louis writes to me that the
inhabitants of Orleans were equally pleased, and consider the war
over. I earnestly pray it may be so. How greatly relieved and
thankful all Germany would be!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_272" id="page_272">{272}</a></span></p>

<p>Louis telegraphed to-day. He has no leave as yet, though he hopes
for it. Now that there is a prospect of peace, and that the
fighting is momentarily over, I feel quite a collapse of my nerves,
after the strain that has been on them for six whole months. I can
scarcely imagine what it will be when my beloved Louis is at home
again; it seems <i>too great</i> a joy! Rest and quiet together are what
I long for; and I fear in the first weeks he will have so much to
do, and there will be much going on.</p>

<p>He speaks with the greatest hope of going to Scotland this autumn;
and, if we are spared to do so, it will be such a rest, and do good
to our healths, which must feel the wear and tear sooner or later.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
February 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>Many thanks for your last kind letter. I thought so much of you
yesterday, spending the dear 10th for the first time again at
Windsor. To day our little son is to be christened, but only the
family will be present, and my ladies and the two wounded
gentlemen, who can get about on crutches now. When I think that the
one owes his life to being here, it always gives me pleasure.</p>

<p>Two nights ago I was awakened by a dreadful noise, the whole house
and my bed rocking from it; and twice again, though less violently.
It was an earthquake, and I think too unpleasant. It frightens one
so; the doors and windows rattle and shake. To-night two slight
shocks, and one during the day yesterday.</p>

<p>How I shall miss dear Louis to-day! The seven months will be round
ere we meet, I fear, and he has never seen his dear little boy. It
always makes me sad to look at him, though now I have every reason
to hope&mdash;please God&mdash;that I shall have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_273" id="page_273">{273}</a></span> joy of seeing Louis
come home, and of placing his baby in his arms. My heart it full,
as you can fancy, and, much as I long to see Louis, I almost dread
the moment&mdash;the emotion will be so great, and the long pent-up
feelings will find vent.</p>

<p>I pray that peace may be restored, and that I may not live to see
<i>such</i> a war again, or to see my sons have to go to it.</p>

<p>I will tell Christa to write an account to you of the christening,
for Leopold to see also, as he will be godfather. Frederic William
Augustus (after the Empress) Victor (victory) Louis will be his
names. Fritz and Vicky, the Empress and Fritz Carl, are godparents.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, February 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>My bad eyes must again excuse the shortness of these lines, which
are to thank you many times for your last dear letter.</p>

<p>Christa will have sent you the account of little Fritz’s
christening, which was a sad day for me, and will have been so for
dear Louis likewise. We have added dear Leopold’s name to the
other, as his sad life, and the anxiety his health has so often
caused us all, endear him particularly, and we hoped it would give
him pleasure, poor boy.</p>

<p>The elections in the provinces are all for peace, and only the
towns for war and a republic. This week is one of intense and
anxious expectation; though the greater portion believe in the
restoration of peace, yet we have no security for it.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Now dear Louise’s marriage draws near, how much you must feel
it! I think so much of her, of your and of my dear home. I trust
she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_274" id="page_274">{274}</a></span> be very happy, which with such an amiable young man she
must be.</p>

<p>Louis has received the Order “<i>Pour le mérite</i>,” which I am so glad
of for him. The Emperor telegraphed the announcement to my
mother-in-law, with many complimentary words about her sons. To
have the three sons safe is something to be thankful for, for they
were much and continually exposed. I know nothing of Louis’ coming.
The troops march home, and it will take at least six weeks. I hope
so much that he may have leave for a fortnight, and then return to
the troops, to lead them home.</p>

<p>To-night are the peace illuminations here, which will be very
pretty. Our house will also be illuminated, and I take the two
eldest girls out with me to-night to see it all. It is a thing for
them never to forget, this great and glorious, though too horrid,
war.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
March 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>I know nothing as yet of Louis’ return. I fear I must wait a few
weeks longer. On Wednesday the Emperor, Fritz, and some of the
Princes pass through Frankfort, and I am going there with my
parents-in-law to see them.</p>

<p>The Paris news is not very edifying, and I fear France has not seen
the worst yet, for there seems to be a fearful state of anarchy
there.</p>

<p>I have no news to give, save that Frittie has his first tooth. He
is between Victoria and Irène, but not like Ernie&mdash;not near so big,
which is really not necessary. I think he is the sort of baby you
admire. I go on looking after my hospitals, and now the trains,
full of Landwehr returning home cheering and singing, begin to
pass. Now good-bye, darling Mama. I am in thought daily with you
during these<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_275" id="page_275">{275}</a></span> days, and only wish it had been in my power to be of
any use or comfort to you just now.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, April 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We had the pleasure of catching a glimpse of Louise and Lorne
on their way through, but their stay was too short to be able to
say more than a few words. They can scarcely help passing through
here, as they can’t go through France, on their way back; and if
you would allow them <i>quite incognito</i> on their way back to pass a
day here, it would give both Louise and me the greatest pleasure,
and entail no other visits.</p>

<p>The Emperor, who kindly gave Louis leave, prolonged it till Monday,
when he leaves, and for how long is quite undecided. If I could
only go with him! Marie of Saxony has joined George: so has Carola
[the Crown Princess of Saxony] her husband; but our division, which
is near Chumont, is in too bad and close quarters to admit of my
living there.</p>

<p>Should Louis have to remain very long, I still hope to rejoin
him&mdash;I don’t care about the little discomfort.</p>

<p>The new governess, Frl. Kitz, comes on Thursday. She is not young,
but pleasing-looking&mdash;said to be very amiable, and a good
governess; has been for eighteen years in England, first with Lady
Palk, and then for ten years with Herr Kleinwart&mdash;a rich German
banker in London&mdash;where she brought up the two daughters.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, April 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Ernie’s kilt was sent him by Mr. Mitchell.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> He admired
Ernie so much at Berlin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_276" id="page_276">{276}</a></span> that he said he would send him a Scotch
dress, and I could not refuse. It is rather small as it is, and I
hope that you will still give him one, as from his Grandmama it
would be doubly valuable.</p>

<p>Louis has arrived safely at his destination&mdash;Donjeux; and we both
feel the separation very much after having had the happiness of
being together again.</p>

<p>The Paris battles are too dreadful, and the end seems some way off
yet.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
May 27th.<br />
</p>

<p>My thoughts cannot leave unfortunate Paris! What horrors, and
enacted so close by in the centre of the civilized world! It seems
incredible; and what a lesson for those who wish to learn by it!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, June 8th.<br />
</p>

<p>Louise and Lorne are just gone, and it rains and blows, and is
dreadful. Their visit was so pleasant, so <i>gemüthlich</i>, and I think
Louise looks well and happy. She had much to tell of their journey,
which seems to have been very interesting. I could show them almost
nothing, as the weather was so bad. We three went yesterday evening
to my parents-in-law, who were most kind to them, as they always
are to all my relations.</p>

<p>Their short stay was a great <i>great</i> pleasure to me, so cut off
from home as I have been since three long years.</p>

<p>Louis will be here in a few days, and we go together to Berlin for
four days; Louis insists on my accompanying him. On the 24th the
entry of the troops will be here.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Seeheim</span>, June 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am so glad that the poor Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_277" id="page_277">{277}</a></span> and Empress are so kindly
treated. They deserve to be well used by England, for the Emperor
did so much to bring France and England together. How shamefully
the French treat them, and speak of them, is not to be told; for
the French consider themselves blameless, and always betrayed by
others, whom they had made almost their gods of, as long as all
went well.</p>

<p>Dear Frittie is getting better&mdash;principally his looks, but the
illness is not overcome yet. I have been so anxious about him. The
country here is more beautiful than ever, and country air and
flowers are a great enjoyment. Every little walk is up and down
hill, little brooks, rocks, small green valleys, fine woods, etc. I
have not lived here since 1865, when Ella was a baby. The children
are beside themselves with pleasure at the pretty country and the
scrambling walks, but above all at the wild flowers, in which they
are getting quite learned. I find them in a book for them, and even
Ernie knows some names, and never calls them wrong. All my children
are great lovers of nature, and I develop this as much as I can. It
makes life so rich, and they can never feel dull anywhere, if they
know to seek and find around them the thousand beauties and wonders
of nature. They are very happy and contented, and always see, the
less people have the less they want, and the greater is the
enjoyment of that which they have. I bring my children up as simply
and with as few wants as I can, and, above all, teach them to help
themselves and others, so as to become independent.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, June 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>I write at the dinner-table, whilst the children finish dinner, as
I have not found a spare moment yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_278" id="page_278">{278}</a></span> and the rest of my afternoon
is taken up with the preparations for to-morrow.</p>

<p>The Empress Augusta has just been here for three hours, quite
dead-tired with all she went through.</p>

<p>Thousand thanks for your dear letter received before our departure
for Potsdam! Our journey was dreadful. We left in the evening, and
were to have been here at 11 <small>A.M.</small>, and through the irregularity of
the trains we only got here at four in the afternoon. I am quite
done up. The fatigues at Berlin were incessant. Any thing more
grand, more imposing or touching and <i>erhebend</i> [elevating] than
the entry of the troops in Berlin I never saw. It was a wonderful
sight to drive for three-quarters of an hour through rows of French
cannon! The decorations were so artistic, so handsome, and the
enthusiasm of the dense crowds quite enormous. I am glad to have
been there; it will be a thing to recollect. The old Emperor,
surrounded by the many princes and by his great generals, looked so
noble riding at the head of his glorious troops. Deputations of all
the German troops were there.</p>

<p>It was very hot, and we had to drive every day to Berlin, and back
in the evening.</p>

<p>Alas! it is rainy here, and the town is so beautifully decorated;
three large triumphal arches, and the houses covered with garlands
and flags.</p>

<p>I found the dear children well, though rather pale from the heat.</p>

<p>Louis left again this morning, but after to-morrow remains here for
good, which will indeed be a pleasure after such endless
separations.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, June 27th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To-day Aunt Marie of Russia and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_279" id="page_279">{279}</a></span> children were here. Aunt
Marie looks thinner than ever, but well; and Marie dear and nice,
with such a kind fresh face, so simple and girlish. She gives her
brothers music lessons during the journey, which she is very proud
of. She is very fond of children, and of a quiet country life&mdash;that
is the ideal she looks for. The Emperor of Russia comes here on the
5th, to join Aunt Marie at Petersthal. Louis’ work is
incessant&mdash;the selling off of horses, the changing garrisons of the
regiments, the new formation of our division, causes almost more
work than the <i>Mobilmachung</i> [mobilization]. The entry was very
beautiful: the decorations of the town most tasteful; not a house
or the smallest street which was not covered with garlands, flags,
and emblems. There were large groups of the captured guns, and the
names of the battles on shields around. Unfortunately, it poured
nearly all the time, and we were quite drenched. I had the five
children in my carriage, and Irène gave wreaths to her godfathers
of the cavalry brigade. Two days ago we gave a large military
dinner, and have several soirées of that sort to give before we can
go into the country, which I am longing for. We shall probably go
to Seeheim, as the summer seems too damp for Kranichstein.</p>

<p>The middle of August we shall go to Blankenberghe, near Ostend, as
the doctors wish sea-bathing for Louis, and sea air for me and for
some of the children, which is very necessary to set us up before
going to Scotland. We want to remain one or two days and one night
in London. We require a few things, which make a stay necessary. If
we might be at Balmoral on the 10th, as Louis’ birthday is on the
12th, would that suit you?</p>

<p>Please let me know in time if you think our plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_280" id="page_280">{280}</a></span> good. This will
enable us to settle when to go to Blankenberghe, as we can’t be
there longer than three weeks.</p>

<p><i>How</i> I look forward to seeing you again, and to come home once
more! It is so kind of you to let us bring the children. The
arrangement of the rooms will do perfectly, and we don’t care how
we are put up, and above all things don’t wish to be in the way.</p>

<p>The weather is horrid&mdash;rain and wind incessantly&mdash;after having been
tremendously hot. These sudden changes upset every one, and Frittie
has had a very slight return of his illness.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
August 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The newest news is, that my nice excellent Marie Grancy is
going to marry. She will be such a loss to me. These last years she
has been so useful, so amiable, and I shall miss her dreadfully.
She is going to marry Major von Hesse, who was with us in England
the last time, and the wedding is to be in September. As he has
been ill in consequence of the war, they will go to Italy and spend
the winter there.</p>

<p>We leave at eight to-morrow morning, reach Cologne at one o’clock,
and wait there till ten in the evening, when we continue our
journey and reach Blankenberghe at eight next morning. Will you
kindly send a gentleman to Gravesend, who can remain with us in
London, as we are quite alone?</p>

<p>Uncle George, Aunt Cambridge, and Mary dined with us at Frankfort
two days ago. Mary I had not seen for three years; she was looking
very handsome.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Blankenberghe</span>, August 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>Only two words to say that we arrived safe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_281" id="page_281">{281}</a></span> well here yesterday
after a very hot journey. The hotel is on the beach where we sit
all day; there are no walks or any thing save the beach, and no
trees. Our rooms are very small and not very clean; but the
heavenly sea air and the wind refresh one, and the sands are very
long. One can ride on donkeys, which enchants young and old
children. Every one bathes together, and one has to take a little
run before the waves cover one. We bathed with the three girls this
morning, but I felt quite shy, for all the people sit round and
look on, and there are great numbers of people here. Our children
play about with others and dig in the sand. Frittie sleeps so well
since he has been here; his color is beginning to return.</p>

<p>We have one small sitting-room, which is our dining-room, and
Louis’ dressing-room.</p>

<p>I was so sad and upset at taking leave of my dear Marie Grancy the
other day; a kind true friend and companion has she been to me
these nine years, and during the war she was quite invaluable to
me. I hope she will be as happy as she deserves to be.</p></div>

</p>

<p>The pleasure of seeing your dear handwriting again has been so
great! Thank God that you are going on well. I do feel <i>so much</i>
for you, and for all you have had to suffer in every way! I trust
entire quiet and rest of mind and body, and any little attention
that I may be able to offer for your comfort, will make the autumn
of real benefit for your health. How I do look forward to seeing
you again, I can’t say. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>We propose leaving the evening of the 13th. Bertie and Uncle George
have arranged for our going to Aldershot on Monday and Tuesday,
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_282" id="page_282">{282}</a></span> interests Louis above all things, and I fancied this
arrangement would suit you best.</p>

<p>The journey has quite cured Frittie, without any medicine, and the
heat is over.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I took Victoria and Ella to the Exhibition, and what
enchanted Ella most was a policeman, who was, as she said, “so very
kind” in keeping the crowd off. It reminded me of “Susy Pusy,”
which dear Papa used to tease me with as a child.</p>

<p>We dined and lunched with Bertie, who had only just arrived, and is
gone again. Dear Arthur of course I have not seen.</p></div>

</p>

<p>In Bertie’s tent I write these few lines to thank you in Louis’
name and my own a thousand times for your dear kind letter. Every
loving word is so precious to us, and the presents you so kindly
gave Louis enchanted him. The pin, unfortunately, did not arrive.</p>

<p>How I regret each time I hear you speak of your illness! I have
been so anxious about you. Uncle Louis and my parents-in-law, in
their telegram of to-day, enquire after you.</p>

<p>We have had two such interesting days; the country too lovely, each
day in a quite different part. We accompanied Uncle George, and in
this way have seen the two Divisions, and through sleeping here
will be enabled to see the third Division to-morrow before
returning to town.</p>

<p>I saw dear Arthur yesterday. He rode with me all the time, and
to-day we met him marching with his company. How I have enjoyed
seeing your splendid troops again, I can’t tell you; but I shall
reserve all news till we meet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_283" id="page_283">{283}</a></span></p>

<p>Louis thanks you again and again for your kindness, and only
regrets not having seen you himself, but is very grateful that we
were allowed to stay a few days at Buckingham Palace, through which
we were enabled to come here, which to him as a soldier is of the
very greatest interest. Bertie is full of his work, and I think it
interests him immensely. He has charming officers about him, to
help and show him what to do. To our great disappointment we did
not see the 42d. Highlanders, the “Black Watch” to-day; but
yesterday we saw the Agyleshire 91st Highlanders, who gave Louise
the present. Bertie lent me a charming little horse, but the ground
is dreadful, and not having ridden for so long, and being on
horseback so many hours, makes me feel quite stiff.</p></div>

</p>

<p>I wish your telegram had brought me better news of you. I really
can’t bear to think of you suffering, and so much alone. I feel it
quite wrong to have left you, and my thoughts and wishes are
continually with you, and distract my attention from all I see
here. I can’t tell you how much I feel for you at being so
helpless. It is such a trial to any one so active as yourself; but
your trial must be drawing to a close, and you will be rewarded in
the end, I am sure, by feeling perhaps even better and stronger
than you did before all your troubles.</p>

<p>I was nearly sick in the train, which is the slowest I was ever in
my life, and was unable to go to dinner; but a long walk by the sea
this morning has quite set me up in spite of the extraordinary
warmth.</p></div>

<p>It is the first time since eleven years that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_284" id="page_284">{284}</a></span> spent Bertie’s
birthday with him, and though we are only three of our own family
together, still that is better than nothing, and makes it seem more
like birthday. Bertie and Alix are so kind, and give us so warm a
welcome, showing how they like having us, that it feels quite home.
Indeed I pray earnestly that God’s blessing may rest on him, and
that he may be guided to do what is wise and right, so that he may
tide safely through the anxious times that are before him, and in
which we now live. They are both charming hosts, and all the party
suit well together. The Westminsters and Brownlows are here; Lady
B. is so very handsome.</p>

<p>We joined the shooting party for luncheon, and the last beats out
to-day and yesterday; and the weather is beautiful, though cold&mdash;a
very bracing air, like Scotland.</p></div>

<h3><a name="yr-1872" id="yr-1872">1872</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Princess did not return to Darmstadt with her children till the end
of January, passing through Brussels on her way. Prince Louis was
invested with the order of the Black Eagle at the “Krönungs- und
Ordensfest” at Berlin. Many of their relations visited the Prince and
Princess during the early part of the year.</p>

<p>On the 6th of June another daughter was born, and she was christened on
the 1st of July, the anniversary of her parents’ wedding-day. Her names
were Victoria Alix Helena Louise Beatrice. The sponsors were the Prince
and Princess of Wales, the Cesarewitch and Cesarewna, Princess Beatrice,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_285" id="page_285">{285}</a></span> Duchess of Cambridge, and the Landgravine of Hesse.</p>

<p>In August the Crown Prince of Prussia paid his first visit to Darmstadt
since the war, and met with a most loyal and hearty reception.</p>

<p>In consequence of the death of the Princess Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the
beloved half-sister of the Queen, in September, the Prince and Princess
went to Baden to be present at the last sad ceremony, and to see their
beloved aunt borne to her rest.</p>

<p>A fortnight later the general assembly of the various German societies
for charitable purposes held its first meeting at Darmstadt.</p>

<p>All these societies, including the “Ladies’ Union,” founded by Princess
Alice, had, in 1869, joined themselves together to form one great body.
During the year 1872 the Princess added another Institution to those she
had already called into existence&mdash;viz., an Orphan Asylum. A special
committee of ladies was at the head of it, to watch over it, and also,
if necessary, to advise and help those poor orphans who had been boarded
out in private families at the expense of the parish. This institution
has already proved most successful, thanks to the readiness with which
the authorities met all Princess Alice’s wishes.</p>

<p>The general assembly at Darmstadt&mdash;the “Frauentag” or “Ladies’ Diet,” as
it was called&mdash;distinguished itself, not only by the extremely discreet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_286" id="page_286">{286}</a></span>
and practical manner in which it carried out all the many different
branches of business which it had undertaken, but also by the presence
of several remarkable persons interested in its aims and objects, such
as Madame Marie Simon, the founder and head of the Institution for
training nurses at Dresden, and three English ladies, Miss Mary
Carpenter, Miss Florence Hill, and Miss Winkworth.</p>

<p>The subjects treated of at the general assembly were the admission of
women to the Post Office and Telegraph Service; the results of the
working of F. Froebel’s principles for the further employment of women;
of “Kindergarten”; the finding of proper localities for the exhibition
and sale of women’s handiwork of all kinds; nursing as a branch of
female industry; the provision of better schools for girls, and what had
been done, and was doing, in England for female education and at similar
institutions.</p>

<p>The Princess followed all the discussions with the keenest interest. She
received all the members of the different societies at her own palace,
and for each she had a kind and encouraging word.</p>

<p>None of those present will ever forget the sympathy and encouragement
they met with from the Princess. She not only advised and suggested
things, but herself took the initiative in any important question which
came under her notice. The general assembly did great credit to itself
in the eyes of Germany, and, indeed, of other countries as well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_287" id="page_287">{287}</a></span> and
its members were encouraged to still further exertions.</p>

<p>The Princess herself was full of new plans for further good works. At
the beginning of November Prince and Princess Louis were present at the
unveiling of a monument erected to the memory of the Hessian soldiers
who fell in the war of 1870. The Princess herself placed some wreaths at
its base. The 14th of December, the anniversary of the Prince Consort’s
death, the Princess spent with her sister the Crown Princess of Prussia,
who had come to Darmstadt from Carlsruhe for the purpose.</p>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Louis returns to-morrow from Berlin. He was the first to be
invested by the Emperor, and has met with great kindness. He was
very glad to have been there with dear Arthur, who seems to please
every one.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
February 5th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is a great pleasure to have dear Arthur here. He is so
amiable, civil, and nice, and takes interest in all he sees, and is
so pleasant to have in the house. His visit will be very short, as
he gives up two days to go to Baden.</p>

<p>We gave small suppers on two evenings for Arthur, and yesterday
evening a celebrated, most excellent violinist played quite as well
as Joachim: a friend of his, and a pupil of Spöhr’s. This afternoon
he is going to play some of Bach’s celebrated sonatas with and to
me. Arthur enjoys music very much, and keeps up his playing.</p>

<p>There is a dance at Uncle Alexander’s to-night, on Wednesday a
Court ball, and on Friday one at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_288" id="page_288">{288}</a></span> my parents-in-law. I can’t stand
the heat at all of an evening, and the rooms are very hot. Louis,
who has an awful cold, took Arthur to see the barracks, as all
military things give him pleasure.</p>

<p>It is heavenly sunny weather, having been quite dark and foggy all
day yesterday.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Louis has been in Upper Hesse the last four days shooting
<i>Auerhähne</i>, but as yet unsuccessfully. My mother-in-law is very
grateful for your kind message, and is better, though weak. She has
had a narrow escape from fever.</p>

<p>Frittie has again endless bruises, with lumps, as Leo used to have;
but he is taking iron, as Sir William [Jenner] wished, and is
strong and rosy and well otherwise. I trust he may outgrow this.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>Many thanks for your dear letter and kind wishes for the birth of
our baby<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>&mdash;a nice little thing, like Ella, only smaller and
with finer features, though the nose promises to be long. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Kind Dr. Hofmeister was most attentive; and of course having him
was far pleasanter than not, and we owe you great thanks for having
sent him. Mrs. Clarke has been all one could wish.</p>

<p>Louis wrote as soon as he could, but this last week he has only
been home just before his dinner, and was so tired that he
invariably fell asleep. He has gone out at six, returning at
twelve, and has had to be out before four in the afternoon,
returning at eight. He is away again to-day. Until the 15th of
September his duty will be important, and he has all the office
work besides. It is double<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_289" id="page_289">{289}</a></span> this year to what it usually is, as all
people and things are new since the war.</p>

<p>How sad the loss of those two poor children is,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and the sweet
little “bairnie” of three! The unfortunate mother to lose two in so
dreadful a way! I am sure it touched Beatrice much to see the poor
little one; and in a child death so often loses every thing that is
painful.</p>

<p>We think of calling our little girl “Alix” (Alice they pronounce
too dreadfully in German) “Helena Louise Beatrice,” and, if
Beatrice may, we would much like to have her as godmother.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, June 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We both felt so truly for you when we heard of dear Dr.
Macleod’s death, knowing what a kind and valued friend of yours he
was, and how fate seems to take one friend after another, and
before age can claim its right. He indeed deserves his rest, for he
did so much good in his life!</p>

<p>I feel rather weaker than usual this time, and sitting and walking,
though only a few steps, tries me a good deal. I was out for half
an hour yesterday, and I think the air will do me good.</p>

<p>Louis left at half-past five this morning, and will be back by
seven, I hope, this evening; to-morrow the same.</p>

<p>I will add Vicky’s name to baby’s others, as you propose; and
“Alix” we gave for “Alice,” as they murder my name here: “Aliicé”
they pronounce it, so we thought “Alix” could not so easily be
spoilt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_290" id="page_290">{290}</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Alexander is coming back shortly, and says the Empress is not
to return to Russia this winter, and will be sent to Italy for the
whole winter.</p>

<p>The heat has been quite dreadful; there is a little air to-day,
though.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Baby is like Ella, only smaller features, and still darker
eyes with very black lashes, and reddish-brown hair. She is a
sweet, merry little person, always laughing, with a deep dimple in
one cheek just like Ernie.</p>

<p>We are going to Frankfort to-day to give Uncle George and Fritz
Strelitz a luncheon in our Palais there. Hélène Reuter comes to us
for a month to-morrow as lady.</p>

<p>I hope your Edinburgh visit will go off well. You have never lived
in Holyrood since 1861, have you?</p>

<p>How I shall think of you at dear Balmoral, and this time capable of
enjoying it&mdash;not like last time, when you had to suffer so much,
and were unable to do any thing. It quite spoiled our visit to see
you an invalid. Remember me to all old friends there&mdash;to Brown’s
kind old mother, and any who ask after us.</p>

<p>I shall think of you on dear Grandmama’s birthday. She is never
forgotten by any of us, and lives on as a dearly-cherished memory
of all that was good and loving, and so kind. My children have her
picture in their room, and I often tell them of her.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, August 20th.<br />
</p>

<p>I am very grateful for your telegrams from Edinburgh, and for
Flora’s [MacDonald] letter. It interests me so much to know what
you did there, and I am very glad all went off so well. The people
will have been too delighted to have had you in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_291" id="page_291">{291}</a></span> their midst again,
and I am sure you enjoyed the beauty of your fine northern capital
anew after not having seen it for so long a time. Beatrice seems
delighted with what she saw. I recollect those many interesting and
beautiful spots so well.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The 18th was the anniversary of the dreadful battle of Gravelotte,
which cost so many lives, to our division especially. We drove into
town to the military church, which was full of officers and men, at
half-past seven in the morning, and thought much of the friends and
acquaintances in their distant graves, and of the desolate homes,
until that day so bright. My heart felt too full when we were
singing <i>Ein’ feste Burg</i>, and I had my husband at my side, whom
the Almighty had graciously spared to my children and myself.
Gratitude seems barely enough to express the intense depth of what
I feel when I think of that time, and how again and again I long to
give all and all to my good dear Louis and to our children, for he
is all that is good and true and pure.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The children were much distressed at the sad fate of my poor
little bullfinch, who piped beautifully. Louis had caught an owl
and put it in a wooden sort of a cage in the room where my bird
was. In the night it broke the bars and got loose and tore the
bullfinch’s tail out, and the poor little thing died in
consequence.</p>

<p>Of our quiet country life there is little to tell. We are a good
deal out, always with our little people, their pets&mdash;dogs, cats,
ponies, donkeys; it is rather like a menagerie.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Schloss Kranichstein</span>, September 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;On Sunday the Moriers with their chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_292" id="page_292">{292}</a></span>dren were with us for
the day. He looked so white and reduced, walks on crutches, but
retains, as always, his spirits and his lively interest for all
things. He is a kind, warm-hearted man, to whom we are both
attached. Alice feels the loss of her poor sister deeply, and says
her father has been so cut up about it.</p>

<p>We took them to races close by, and feared we should be upset, the
ground being very heavy and uneven, and I was in terror for Mr.
Morier, who was in my carriage.</p>

<p>On the 9th there is a large meeting here of the different
associations existing throughout Germany for the bettering of
women’s education and social position (of the middle class
especially with regard to trade). Some English ladies are coming,
some Swiss and Dutch. It will last four days, and be very
fatiguing. The programme I arranged with my two committees here and
the gentlemen at Berlin, and they wanted to force me to preside;
but for so large an assemblage&mdash;to me nearly all strangers&mdash;I
positively refused. I do that in my own Associations, but not where
there are so many strangers, who all want to talk, and all to cross
purposes. It is difficult enough to keep one’s own people in order
when they disagree. I hope and trust I have prevented <i>all</i>
exaggerated and unfeminine views being brought up, which to me are
dreadful. These Associations, if not reasonably led, tend too
easily to the ridiculous. My Associations take a great deal of my
time and thought, and require a good amount of study. I hope and
trust that what we are doing here is the right thing. We have
already had some satisfactory results in the class of the
workwomen, and in the reform of the schools; but there are many<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_293" id="page_293">{293}</a></span>
open questions yet, which I hope this meeting, with others who work
in the same field, may help us to solve.</p>

<p>Will you look through the programme? It would please me so much, if
I thought, you took a little interest in my endeavors here in a
very small way to follow in a slight degree part of dear Papa’s
great works for the good of others.</p>

<p>The meeting at Berlin seems to have gone off very well, and has
pleased all Germans, who hope for a consolidation of peace&mdash;so
necessary to them.</p>

<p>We have an entire change of Ministry at Darmstadt, the first since
1848, which fills all with hopes for an improvement in all the
affairs of the Grand Duchy.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, September 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;<i>All</i> sympathize with you, and feel what a loss to you
darling Aunt<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> must be&mdash;how great the gap in your life, how
painful the absence of that sympathy and love which united her life
and yours so closely.</p>

<p>Darling, kind Mama, I feel so acutely for you, that my thoughts are
incessantly with you, and my prayers for comfort and support to be
granted you in the heavy trial are warm indeed. You have borne so
many hard losses with courage and resignation, that for darling
Aunt’s sake you will do so again, and knowing her at rest and peace
will in time reconcile you to the loss&mdash;all the more as her passing
from this world to another was so touchingly peaceful. Dear Augusta
[Stanley] wrote to me, which was a great consolation, and we intend
going to Baden to pay our last token of respect and love.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_294" id="page_294">{294}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;A few words about our doings here may be of interest to you.
The meeting went off well, was very large, the subjects discussed
were to the purpose and important, and not one word of the
emancipated political side of the question was touched upon by any
one. Schools (those of the lower, middle, and higher classes) for
girls was the principal theme; the employment of women for post and
telegraph offices, etc.; the improvement necessary in the education
of nursery-maids, and the knowledge of mothers in the treatment of
little children; the question of nurses and nursing institutes.</p>

<p>The committees of the fifteen Associations met Wednesday afternoon,
and in the evening thirteen of the members came to us to supper.</p>

<p>The public meeting on the following day lasted from nine to two
with a small interruption; a committee meeting in the afternoon;
and that evening all the members and guests came to us&mdash;nearly
fifty in number. The following day the meetings lasted even longer,
and the English ladies were kind enough to speak&mdash;only think, old
Miss Carpenter, on all relating to women’s work in England (she is
our guest here). Her account of the Queen’s Institute at Dublin was
most interesting. Miss Hill (also our guest), about the
boarding-out system for orphans. Miss C. Winkworth, about higher
education in England. She mentioned also the new institution to
which Louise now belongs, and is a member of it herself. The ladies
all spoke very well; the German ones remarkably so.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of work to finish afterward, and a good many
members to see. They came from all parts of Germany&mdash;many
kind-hearted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_295" id="page_295">{295}</a></span> noble, self denying women. The presence of the
English ladies&mdash;above all, of one such as Miss Carpenter, who has
done such good works for the reformation of convicts&mdash;greatly
enhanced the importance of the meeting, and her great experience
has been of value to us all. She means still to give a lecture on
India and the state of the native schools there, before leaving us.</p>

<p>I have still so much work in hand, that I fear my letter is hurried
and ill-written, but I hope you will kindly excuse this.</p>

<p>To-morrow I am taking Miss Carpenter to all our different schools,
that she may see how the different systems in use work. Some are
good, but none particularly so; there is much to improve.</p>

<p>Louis is gone to Mayence to-day for the inauguration of the
Memorial which the town has erected to the memory of dear excellent
Waldemar Holstein, for so many years its beloved Governor.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>You must indeed miss dear Aunt much, and feel your thoughts drawn
to her, whose precious intercourse was such a solace and comfort to
you. It is nice for you to have Louise a little to yourself. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>You ask, if my mother-in-law talks with me about the different
woman’s work in which I am interested. Of course she does. We are
so intimate together, that even where we differ in opinion we yet
talk of every thing freely, and her opinion is of the greatest
value to me. She had ever been a most kind, true, and loving
mother, whom I respect and love more and more. She was much pleased
and interested in the success of the meeting, but is of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_296" id="page_296">{296}</a></span> as
adverse as myself to all extreme views on such subjects.</p>

<p>I have joined to my Nursing Institute an Association for watching
over the orphans who are boarded-out by the State into families,
where some poor children are unhappy and ill-used. The use of such
meetings as this one was consists mainly in the interchange of
experience made in the different branches in other places, which it
is impossible to carry on by correspondence.</p>

<p>The schools are entirely different throughout Germany&mdash;good and
indifferent; and those here do not count among the best, as every
thing, through the long misrule of the late Government, is not what
it ought to be.</p>

<p>Uncle Louis has a new Ministry now, which gives every one cause for
hope.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The weather is awful here; the wind sounds in the house as if
one were at sea.</p>

<p>This article was sent me the other day, and though I half fear
seeming <i>unbescheiden</i> [overbold], yet, as you spoke of your
feelings about women’s meetings the other day, I venture to send
it.</p>

<p>Ella is writing to you herself to thank you for the lovely
bracelet, which gave me as much pleasure as it did her. To think
that she is already eight! She is handsomer than she was, and a
dear child. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;They all give me pleasure, dear children, though
of course they have as many faults as others; but they are truthful
and contented, and very affectionate. Having them much with me,
watching and guiding their education&mdash;which, through our quiet and
regular life, is possible&mdash;I am able to know and understand their
different characters, for not one is like the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_297" id="page_297">{297}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, November 12th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We have the same weather here which you seem to have, which
for our long journey was not pleasant. We took nearly twelve hours
going, and as much returning from Metz. For the inauguration itself
the weather held up. The roads were dreadful, and the wide plateau
looked dreary and sad&mdash;dotted all over with graves, like an
enormous churchyard.</p>

<p>The memorial is a dead lion in bronze, on a plain pedestal, bearing
an inscription on black marble in front, and at the back all the
names. Deputations of officers and men were present, besides the
generals, etc., from Metz. The clergyman of the division read the
prayers, preached a short and touching sermon, and the band played
a chorale. Louis spoke a few words, ending with the usual “Hoch”
for the Emperor and Grand Duke. I then laid some wreaths at the
foot of the Memorial from Louis’ parents and ourselves, and we
drove back to Metz across the different battlefields. The villages
are all built up again, and re-inhabited, so that few traces of the
dreadful struggle remain.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The Empress of Russia wrote the other day that the alliance
with Marie<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> of Mecklenburg is quite impossible, as she won’t
change her religion. I hope all other German Princesses will follow
her example.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, December 12th.<br />
</p>

<p>For the 14th I write a few words. From year to year they can but
express the same; the grief at the loss of such a father, such a
man, grows with me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_298" id="page_298">{298}</a></span> and leaves a gap and a want that nothing on
earth can ever fill up.</p>

<p>The deep, intense sympathy for what you, my poor dear Mama, went
through then and since, in consequence of your bereavement, remains
as vivid as ever. God heard our prayers, and sustained you, and
through the healing hand of time softened your grief, and retained
you for us, who were too young and too numerous to stand alone!</p>

<p>That our good sweet Alix should have been spared this terrible
grief, when this time last year it seemed so imminent, fills my
heart with gratitude for her dear sake, as for yours, his children,
and ours. That time is as indelibly fixed on my memory as that of
1861, when the witnessing of your grief rent my heart so deeply.
The 14th will now be a day of mixed recollections and feelings to
us&mdash;a day <i>hallowed</i> in our family, when one great spirit ended his
work on earth&mdash;though his work can never die, and generations will
grow up and call his name blessed&mdash;and when another was left to
fulfil his duty and mission, God grant, for the welfare of his own
family and of thousands.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>I have not time to write to dearest Bertie and Alix to-day; and as
I love to think of them with you on the 14th, so I would ask you to
let them share these lines full of sympathy for them, letting a
remembrance of <i>me</i>, who suffered with them, mingle with your
united prayers and thanks on this solemn day!</p>

<p>My little Fritz is at length better, but white and thin, in
consequence of his illness.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
Christmas Day.<br />
</p>

<p>Your dear presents gave me so much pleasure; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_299" id="page_299">{299}</a></span> thank you again and
again for them. The precious souvenir of dear Aunt, and my Ernie’s
picture delight me. I assure you, nothing has given me more
pleasure this Christmas.</p>

<p>Let me also thank you, in Louis’ and the children’s names
(meanwhile, until they do so themselves), for your kind gifts to
them. It makes us all so happy and grateful, to be always so kindly
remembered.</p>

<p>The boys were well enough to enjoy Christmas, though rather pale
and pulled&mdash;above all, sweet Ernie.</p>

<p>We gave all our servants presents&mdash;the whole household and
stable&mdash;under the Christmas-tree, which we made for the children;
and when the tree is divided, the children of all our servants come
and share it with ours. It keeps the household as a family, which
is so important. We have fifty people to give to!</p>

<p>Dear Beatrice’s wishes (cards) pleased the children very much, but
Frittie lamented for a letter from Auntie “for Frittie.” He talks
quite well now.</p>

<p>On Saturday we shall go for the day to Vicky. I don’t like leaving
the boys for longer yet. I am so glad Vicky gave such a flattering
account of baby. She is quite the personification of her nickname
“Sunny”&mdash;much like Ella, but a smaller head, and livelier, with
Ernie’s dimple and expression.</p></div>

<h3><a name="yr-1873" id="yr-1873">1873</a>.</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HIS year began brightly and happily to the Prince and Princess, for
little Prince Fritz, whose health had often given rise to serious
anxiety, seemed stronger and better. In March the Princess at last was
able to carry out her long-cherished wish to visit Italy. She travelled
incognita, accompanied by Miss Hardinge and Hofrath Ruland. The journey
was made in a comparatively short time, but was thoroughly successful.
The Princess travelled from Darmstadt by Munich and the Brenner Pass to
Florence, where she spent three days, and from there went straight on to
Rome.</p>

<p>During her stay in the “eternal city” she employed her mornings in
visiting the many beautiful picture-galleries, the churches, and the
ruins of ancient Rome. In the afternoons she made longer excursions into
the neighborhood, visiting the more distant churches in the Campagna, as
well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_301" id="page_301">{301}</a></span> celebrated villas of Albani, Ludovisi, Borghese, etc. She
used to spend her evenings in talking over and discussing all the
objects of interest she had seen during the day. The Princess with her
wonderful power of observation was able to do a large amount of
sight-seeing in a comparatively short time. She was accompanied by
Monsignore Howard (now Cardinal Howard) over St. Peter’s; and he showed
her many interesting parts of this glorious edifice, which in general
are never shown to Protestants. At the “Farnesina,” the private palace
of Count Bermudez, she was received and conducted over it by the Count
himself. The ruins of Rome which interested the Princess the most were
those which dated from the time of the first Christians, as far back as
the early mediæval period, the catacombs of “San Callisto,” and the
curious church of “San Clemente.” Amongst the ceremonies of the “Holy
Week” the Princess was greatly struck by “The Lamentations,” whilst
others made her ask, as all Protestants do, how the pure simple
Christian religion could possibly be so misrepresented. After attending
all the grand ceremonies of the Church of Rome, the quiet service at the
German Embassy made a most happy and peaceful impression on the
Princess. She visited the Pope, Pius IX., who received her with his
usual winning kindness.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> She also went to the Quirinal to pay her
respects to King Victor Emanuel, and to the Crown Princess of Italy,
Princess Margherita.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_302" id="page_302">{302}</a></span> The two Princesses drove together through Rome on
the occasion of the celebration of its “birthday,” and witnessed the
illumination of the Capitol, Forum, and Colosseum.</p>

<p>On the 13th of April the Princess made a brief excursion to Sorrento by
way of Naples, where her father-in-law and the Empress of Russia were
staying. On the 24th of April she left with her suite for Florence,
travelling by way of Perugia and Lake Thrasimene, through the valley of
the Arno. As she had but little time, she was only able to visit the
galleries of the Uffizi and Pitti Palaces, the tombs of the Medici in
San Lorenzo, the Convent of St. Mark, the Cathedral, the Church of Santa
Croce, and the “Museo Nazionale.”</p>

<p>The Princess left Italy on the 28th April, reaching Darmstadt on the 2d
of May.</p>

<p>Her journey had been one of thorough enjoyment, and she felt deeply
grateful that she had at last been able to see with her own eyes those
glorious works of art, which from her childhood she had only been able
to picture dimly to herself.</p>

<p>The joy of her reunion with her family was, alas! not to be of long
duration. Prince Louis had been obliged to leave Darmstadt early on the
morning of the 29th of May to inspect the troops in Upper Hesse, leaving
the Princess still in bed, exhausted from the great fatigue of her
Italian journey. The two little Princes came to wish her “good-morning,”
and by her wish were left in her room by the nurse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_303" id="page_303">{303}</a></span> The children soon
began to play, as was their wont, running in and out of the room into
the adjacent one, and looking from one window and then from another.
Prince Ernest having run into the next room, the Princess followed him,
leaving Prince Fritz in her bedroom. During her almost momentary absence
he fell out of the window on to the stone terrace below. Whether he had
leaned too far out of it and overbalanced himself, or whether in running
fast through the room to the window to look for his brother he could not
stop himself and fell from it, no one actually knows. He was picked up
insensible, and died a few hours afterward in the arms of his distracted
mother. Effusion of blood on the brain caused by the fall ended that
young and bright little life. The loss of this unusually-gifted and
beloved child was a blow to the mother from which she never recovered.
Her married life had till then been such a happy one, that this first
sorrow came on her with redoubled force.</p>

<p>On the evening of Whitsunday, June 1st, the beloved little Prince was
taken to his last resting-place, at the Rosenhöhe (the Grand Ducal
Mausoleum), his parents and sisters and brother being present. It was
very long before the Princess at all recovered from the terrible shock
of the death of her child, though the sympathy shown to her by her
family and friends&mdash;indeed, by all&mdash;greatly comforted and helped her.</p>

<p>In the autumn the Prince and Princess went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_304" id="page_304">{304}</a></span> Heiden in Appenzell for a
little change. From there they paid a visit to the Prince of
Hohenzollern at his castle of the Weinburg. At the end of November they
went to England with their three youngest children, and remained there
till the 23d of December, when they returned to Darmstadt.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, January 12th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We were both much shocked to hear of the death of the Emperor
Napoleon, and I must say grieved; personally he was so amiable, and
she is much to be pitied. That he should die an exile in England
and, as Louis Phillipe did, is most striking. In England the
sympathy shown must touch the poor Empress, and, as I telegraphed,
we should be so grateful to you, if you would kindly be the medium
through which both of us would like to express to her how much we
feel for her. How proud you must ever be, in feeling that your
country is the one always able to offer a home and hospitality for
those driven away from their own countries! England is before all
others in that; and its warm sympathy for those who are in
misfortune is such a generous feeling.</p>

<p>Fannie Baillie’s Victoria is such a nice girl. She comes to our
children every Saturday, and is not above playing at dolls with
them, though she is so much older. There are two rather nice little
English girls, daughters of the chaplin here, who come to them.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
February 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>If any one will feel with us, I know you will do so most. Since
three days, with an interruption of one day, poor Frittie has been
bleeding incessantly from a slight cut on his ear, which was nearly
healed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_305" id="page_305">{305}</a></span> Since yesterday evening we cannot stop it. All the usual
remedies were used, but as yet unavailing. Just now the place has
been touched again with caustic and tightly bound, after we had
with great trouble got rid of the quantity of dried blood from his
hair, ear, neck, etc. He is horrified at the sight of so much
blood, but shows great strength as yet in spite of so great a loss.
He is of course very irritable, and, as he must not scream, one has
to do whatever he wishes, which will spoil him dreadfully. I own I
was much upset when I saw that he had this tendency to bleed, and
the anxiety for the future, even if he gets well over this, will
remain for years to come. All have their trials, one or another,
and, please God, we shall bear whatever is sent without
complaining. To see one’s own child suffer is for a mother a great
trial. With what pleasure one would change places with the little
one, and bear its pain!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
February 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;In the summer Fritz had a violent attack of dysentery, which
was so prevalent at Darmstadt, and off and on for two months it
continued, until Scotland stopped it; and this illness made him
sensitive and delicate.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;What has caused him such great suffering has been that, what
with the use of caustic, the tight bandaging and the iron, a
quantity of small gatherings formed on his cheek and neck, causing
such an amount of pain that he could not remain in bed or anywhere
quiet for the two first days and nights. Now they are drying off,
the itching is such that he don’t know what to do with himself, and
we have the greatest difficulty in keeping him from rubbing or
scratching himself. The want of sleep through pain, etc., has
excited him very much, so that he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_306" id="page_306">{306}</a></span> been very difficult to
manage. The bandages of course cannot be removed, and great care
will be taken when they are removed, lest bleeding should
re-commence. He has been out twice a day as usual all along, and
his skin never quite lost its pinkness and mottled appearance; all
of which are signs that he has good blood and to spare, else he
would look worse and have shown weakness, which after all he did
not. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>He speaks well for his age, and is, alas! very wild, so that it
will be impossible to keep him from having accidents. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have been playing some lovely things (very difficult) of
Chopin lately, which I know you would admire.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, February 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>My best thanks for your dear letter! That I forgot to thank you at
once for dear Grandmama’s very beautiful print<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> came from my
having the lithograph of that picture in my room always before me,
and, though the print far surpasses it, I am so fond of the
lithograph, that I forgot the print at the moment I was writing to
you. Before that dear picture, the painting of which I recollect so
well, my children often sit, and I tell them of her who was and
ever will be so inexpressibly dear to us all. In the schoolroom, in
my sitting-room, in the nursery, there is, with the pictures of you
and dear Papa, always one of dear Grandmama, and, in my room and
the schoolroom, the Duke of Kent also.</p>

<p>My sitting-room has only prints and lithographs, all Winterhalters,
of the family: you and Papa, your receiving the Sacrament at the
Coronation, Raphae<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_307" id="page_307">{307}</a></span>l’s “Disputa” and “Bella Jardiniérre,” and the
lovely little engraving of yourself from Winterhalter’s picture in
Papa’s room at Windsor.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Vicky is coming here on Wednesday. The Grand Duke of Weimar has
kindly allowed Mr. Ruland to join us as cicerone: which for
galleries, etc., is very necessary, and we take no courier. Rome is
our first halting-place in Italy, and for years it has been my
dream and wish to be in that wonderful city, where the glorious
monuments of antiquity and of the Middle Ages carry one back to
those marvellous times.</p>

<p>I am learning Italian, and studying the history and art necessary
to enable me, in the short time we have, to see and understand the
finest and most important monuments. I am so entirely absorbed and
interested in these studies just now, that I have not much time for
other things. My father-in-law, perhaps Princess Charles too, will
be with Aunt Marie of Russia at Sorrento then. William will
probably join us at Rome; he is quite a connoisseur in art, and a
good historian, quite at home in Rome, about which he raves. I must
say that I look forward immensely to this journey; it opens a whole
new life to one. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Kanné has made all arrangements for us at Rome. We shall leave here
about the 18th of March.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Rome</span>, <span class="smcap">Hôtel Allemagne</span>, March 27th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We left the dear children well, but very sorry at parting.
The two days at Munich were most interesting. The National Museum
in its way surpasses any I have ever seen, and in originals is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_308" id="page_308">{308}</a></span>
richer even than South Kensington. Aunt Mariechen was very kind and
dear; the Moriers very amiable hosts, and we met some interesting
people there. Two hours before we left, after eight in the evening,
Ludwig and Otto<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> came to us and remained some time.</p>

<p>The Brenner, over which we came, was covered with snow&mdash;most
beautiful scenery, like St. Moritz in the Engadine. The journey was
very fatiguing. We had a morning for Bologna, and had to wait three
hours at Florence for the night train&mdash;time enough to drive round
and in the town, which is most lovely. What trees, mountains,
colors! then the fine buildings!</p>

<p>The following morning at six we reached Rome. The sun was bright,
the distance blue&mdash;the grand ruins dark and sharp against the sky,
cypresses, stone pines, large cork oaks, making up such a beautiful
picture. Every day I admire the scenery more and more; every little
bit of architecture, broken or whole, with a glimpse of the
Campagna, a picturesque dirty peasant and a dark tree close by, is
a picture in itself which one would like to frame and hang up in
one’s room. It is too, too beautiful! To tell you all we have seen
and are seeing would tire you. Bertie and Arthur’s descriptions,
too, so lately have told you the same.</p>

<p>The Via Appia, the grand old road lined with ruins of splendid
tombs, leading from Albano through the Campagna to Rome, along
which St. Paul went, and the great kings and emperors made their
triumphal entries, is a fit one to lead to such a city as Rome,
which ruled the world.</p>

<p>The antique monuments, those of the Middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_309" id="page_309">{309}</a></span> Ages, are so
magnificent and interesting that as yet I don’t know which to
mention first or admire most!</p>

<p>Our incognito did not last long (though even now we maintain it),
for the Crown Princess heard of us and came to see us, as did the
Crown Prince, and we had to go to the Quirinal, a morning visit
without <i>entourage</i>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Palm Sunday</span>, <span class="smcap">Rome</span>, April 6th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We saw the beginning of mass and blessing of the palms in St.
Peter’s this morning, with a procession and beautiful singing.
Whilst the procession, with part of the choristers, go outside the
church, some remain within, and they respond to each other, which
produces a very striking effect. In spite of the bad style inside
of St. Peter’s, as a whole it produces a marvellous effect through
its wonderful size and richness of decoration.</p>

<p>I saw two convents yesterday: the Sepolte Vive, which Bertie and
Alix saw, and where the nuns asked much after him, and said that he
was <i>molto amabile</i>; and another equally strict one, but not
austere, where the Superior told me that Aunt Feodore with Princess
Hohenzollern had paid them a visit. Monsignore Howard was the only
gentleman with me and the ladies, as they never see any men. Their
idea is, that they spend the whole of their life in contemplation
and prayer, so as to pray for those who cannot pray for themselves.</p>

<p>The museums of the Vatican and of the Capitol, with their enormous
collection of antiques, are very fine. The celebrated Venus, Apollo
Belvidere, the Torso (which Michael Angelo admired so much, and was
taken to touch when he could no more see it), the wounded
Gladiator, etc., are there. The Sistine Chapel, with Michael
Angelo’s frescoes, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_310" id="page_310">{310}</a></span> certainly the most marvellous pieces
of painting and conception, is very dark, and the frescoes are
suffering much from the smoke, dust, etc. Raphael’s Stanze are far
better preserved, and lighter than I had expected, and of such
beauty!</p>

<p>I thought so often and so much of dear Papa, when I saw the
originals of all the pictures he so much admired and took such
interest in. How this alone fascinates me I cannot tell you. In
these galleries and churches there is only too much to be seen,
besides the antique ruins, etc. You would be terrified to see how
full our day is from before nine. Mr. Ruland is an excellent
cicerone for pictures and sculptures. William is with us here since
last Sunday.</p>

<p>We are going to the Villa Ludovisi this afternoon. The gardens of
the Villa Doria Pamfili are most beautiful: the terraces there
remind me of Osborne. I can see in many things where dear Papa got
his ideas from for Osborne and for his decorations, which Professor
Gruner understood so well to carry out.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your having told Lady Churchill to send me an
account of your opening of the Park.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> I am glad that all went
off so well, and that you were not the worse for it.</p>

<p>I have quite refused going to Naples. We shall arrange probably to
go for two days to Castellamare (one hour from Naples); from thence
to Sorrento and Pompeii, and return here. As yet it is not hot here
at all.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Rome</span>, April 9th.<br />
</p>

<p>Let me thank you for your letter written on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_311" id="page_311">{311}</a></span> dear Victoria’s
birthday. I have never been away from her on her birthday before,
and though we see such fine interesting things, yet I feel very
homesick for the dear children always. In three weeks or less I
shall see them again. I look forward all the time with perfect
impatience, as I am so rarely separated from them, and we live so
much together. Every other day Fräulein Kitz and Orchard write, so
that I have news daily.</p>

<p>Louis’ father wrote me to-day, as his sister asks us to her house
at Sorrento for one or two nights for the 12th; but as I was rather
deranged from a sick headache yesterday, I shall wait a day before
we decide. It is wet and quite cold to-day.</p>

<p>We visited San Clemente two days ago, and Father Mulooly took us
through the three churches&mdash;one under the other. The antique one
was full of water, and we walked about on rickety planks, each with
a lighted taper, as it is quite dark there. It is most curious, and
the old paintings on the walls telling the legend of St. Clement
are wonderfully full of expression and feeling for the time they
were done.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Rome</span>, April 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Our visit to Sorrento went off well. We got there at one on
Monday morning for luncheon. The sun had given me a dreadful
headache, which ended in sickness, so that I could not leave my
room. Marie sat with me, and was very dear and kind. The next day,
she and my Aunt, who seems tired and dispirited, had bad headaches.
We went with my father-in-law and some of the ladies and gentlemen
on the following afternoon in the Empress’ yacht to Capri, close
by, to see the blue grotto.</p>

<p>The Bay of Naples, particularly seen from Sor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_312" id="page_312">{312}</a></span>rento, is most
lovely&mdash;like a beautiful dream&mdash;the colors, the outlines are so
perfect.</p>

<p>We breakfasted together in the morning with Aunt and Marie, and on
Tuesday we took our leave.</p>

<p>We shall go to Florence the 23d, (the first station homeward);
remain there three or four days; one night at Verona, and then
home. It is a fatiguing journey, and we have so often had people in
the carriage, which is very unpleasant&mdash;some very rude English,
going to Sorrento; they did not know us.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Florence</span>, April 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>Your kind wishes I received early this morning. Thousand thanks for
them, and for the presents which I shall find on getting home.</p>

<p>I shall be so glad to have a large photograph of yourself. Thirty
years! Good-bye, youth! but I feel quite as old as I am, though the
time has flown by so fast. I would it had flown as well as it has
fast! I look back to the past with great gratitude to the Almighty
for innumerable blessings, and pray our life may continue so blest.
I have a very bad headache&mdash;neuralgia; I have it continually; and
the journey is very long and tiring. Darling Ernie wanted to buy
something for my birthday, and he thought a china doll with a bath
would be the best. I am glad Victoria remembered to write to
Beatrice as I told her; they are very fond of their Auntie.</p>

<p>Florence seems a beautiful town, and the situation amongst the
hills, over which the suburbs spread, is most picturesque.</p>

<p>I enclose the last telegrams from Sorrento. It is <i>fièvre du pays</i>
which Marie had. We remained at Rome a day longer on account of
poor Alfred. He is very patient and hopeful.</p>

<p>The King, whom we saw at the races, sends you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_313" id="page_313">{313}</a></span> his respects, and
was delighted with the cream-colored horse you sent him. Many
thanks for the flowers. I enclose two from here. The account of
your giving away the colors<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> I had already read with interest.</p>

<p>We must go to the Grand Duchess Marie to-morrow; Monday to Verona,
twelve hours; next morning to Munich, and that night to Darmstadt.
How I look forward to seeing the dear children! It seems to me an
age since we parted.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, June 9th.<br />
</p>

<p>Tender thanks for your last letter, and for every word of sympathy!
The weary days drag on, and bring much pain at times, though there
are moments of comfort, and even consolation.</p>

<p>The horror of my darling’s sudden death<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> at times torments me
too much, particularly waking of a morning; but when I think he is
at rest, free from the sorrow we are suffering, and from every evil
to come, I feel quite resigned. He was such a bright child. It
seems so quiet next door; I miss the little feet, the coming to me,
for we lived so much together, and Ernie feels so lost, poor love.</p>

<p>We were at the Mausoleum with all the children yesterday evening.
It is a quiet spot amidst trees and flowers, with a lovely view
toward the hills and plain. He loved flowers so much. I can’t see
one along the roadside without wishing to pick it for him.</p>

<p>There is a young sculptor from Stuttgart, who was accidently here,
and, meeting the children, had asked permission to make medallions
of them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_314" id="page_314">{314}</a></span> <i>last</i> afternoon sweet Frittie had sat to him, and he
is now making a lovely bust of him, which is getting very like.</p>

<p>On Wednesday my mother-in-law, with her three sons, goes to Berlin;
on Thursday Uncle Adalbert<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> will be buried in the Dom.</p>

<p>We sha’n’t be able to go to Seeheim until Saturday.</p>

<p>How <i>too kind</i> of you to have asked us to Osborne! How a rest and
home air would have revived me&mdash;and the pleasure of seeing you
again; but Louis cannot leave until after his birthday. If he did
get leave, it would so throw him out before he has to command; and,
having been absent this spring, he feels it an impossibility, and
this I am sure you will understand. I could not leave him or the
children. Our circle has grown smaller, and drawn us all the more
together with a dread of parting from each other. We thank you a
thousand times for the kind offer.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I do earnestly hope that too long a time may not elapse
before we meet.</p>

<p>It is very hot, and I feel very low and unhappy.</p>

<p>To-morrow this house will be full, and all the Russians, etc.,
close by. Had there only been any other quiet country place to be
at, how gladly would I have escaped this.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is only three weeks to-day since we took our darling to
his last resting-place! I wish I could go there to-day, but it is
too hot and too far.</p>

<p>Fritz and Louise of Baden came two days ago to Darmstadt, to see my
parents-in-law and us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_315" id="page_315">{315}</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Macleod’s letter is very kind.</p>

<p>I enclose two photographs of dear Frittie out of groups, the
negative of one of which unluckily does not exist any more. The
little blouse is the one he had on on that terrible day. My darling
sweet child&mdash;to have lost him so! To my grave shall I carry this
sorrow with me.</p>

<p>In the book you sent me there is a fine poem by Miss Procter, “Our
grief, our friend,” called “Friend Sorrow,” which expresses so much
what I myself feel about a deep grief.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Seeheim</span>, June 27th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It was just four weeks yesterday since our darling died, and
we went to the Mausoleum. I felt the whole weight of my sorrow, and
the terrible shock doubly again. But the precious child does
not&mdash;that is a comfort. He is happy and at rest, whilst we grieve
and mourn. Ernie always prays for Frittie, and talks to me of him
when we walk together.</p>

<p>Aunt Marie arrived at two on Monday, and a few hours later came to
see me, and was so sympathizing, motherly, and loving; it touched
me much. At such moments she is peculiarly soft and womanly, and
she loves her own children so tenderly. She cried much, and told me
of the sad death of her eldest girl, who was seven, and of the
terrible, irreparable loss her eldest son was to her. She has such
a religious, truly resigned way of looking at great sorrows such as
these. In the room I am now living in Aunt Marie had seen Frittie
in his bath two years ago, and she remembered all about him. She is
coming to “Sunshine’s” toilet this evening; it always amuses her,
and she is very fond of the children.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;There are days which seem harder than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_316" id="page_316">{316}</a></span> others, and when I
feel very heartsick, prayer and quiet and solitude do me good.</p>

<p>I hear Affie comes on Thursday night. This evening the Emperor
arrives. Poor Marie<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> is very happy, and so quiet. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How I
feel for the parents, this only daughter (a character of
<i>Hingebung</i> [perfect devotion] to those she loves), the last child
entirely at home, as the parents are so much away that the two
youngest, on account of their studies, no more travel about.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Seeheim</span>, July 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am glad that you have a little colored picture of my
darling. I feel lower and sadder than ever, and miss him so much,
so continually. There is such a gap between Ernie and Sunny, and
the two boys were such a pretty pair, and were become such
companions. Having so many girls, I was so proud of our two boys!
The pleasure did not last long, but he is <i>mine</i> more than ever
now. He seems near me always, and I carry his precious image in my
heart everywhere. That can never fade or die!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Seeheim</span>, August 2d.<br />
</p>

<p>Many thanks for your dear letter! I am feeling so low and weak
to-day that kind words are doubly soothing. You feel so with me,
when you understand how long and deep my grief must be. And does
one not grow to love one’s grief, as having become part of the
being one loved&mdash;as if through <i>this</i> one could still pay a tribute
of love to them, to make up for the terrible loss, and missing of
not being able to do any thing for the beloved one any more?<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_317" id="page_317">{317}</a></span> am so much with my children, and am so accustomed to care for
them and their wants daily, that I miss not having Frittie, the
object of our greatest care, far more than words can describe; and
in the quiet of our every-day life, where we have only the children
around us, it is doubly and trebly felt, and is a sorrow that has
entered into the very heart of our existence.</p>

<p>May the hour of trial and grief bring its blessing with it, and not
have come in vain! The day passes so quickly, when one can do good
and make others happy, and one leaves always so much undone. I feel
more than ever, one should put nothing off; and children grow up so
quickly and leave one, and I would long that mine should take
nothing but the recollection of love and happiness from their home
with them into the world’s fight, knowing that they have there
<i>always</i> a safe harbor, and open arms to comfort and encourage them
when they are in trouble. I do hope that this may become the case,
though the lesson for parents is so difficult, being continually
<i>giving</i>, without always finding the return.</p>

<p>Dear Fannie Baillie has been a few days here, and goes to England
to-day. I shall miss her so much. I am so very fond of her. I hope
you will see her; she will bring you many messages from us.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;After endless difficulties it has been settled that we can go
to the Mainau. I am so far from strong and well that a change is
necessary, and we shall go on the 15th, as Louise of Baden
proposed, and I have written this to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_318" id="page_318">{318}</a></span></p>

<p>How you will enjoy the rest at Balmoral! After so much going on you

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;You ask if I can play yet? I feel as if I could not, and I
have not yet done so. In my own house it seems to me as if I never
could play again on that piano, where little hands were nearly
always thrust when I wanted to play. Away from home&mdash;in
England&mdash;much sooner. I had played so often lately that splendid,
touching funeral march of Chopin’s, and I remember it is the last
thing I played, and then the boys were running in the room.</p>

<p>Mary Teck came to see me and remained two nights, so warm-hearted
and sympathizing. I like to talk of him to those who love children,
and can understand how great the gap, how intense the pain, the
ending of a little bright existence causes.</p>

<p>Soon I shall have my Louis back. I long for him very much; but the
change of air, the active out-door life, and being quite thrown
into men’s society and occupations, must refresh body and mind.
Here he has only me, the governess and children as <i>Umgang</i>. But he
is what the Germans call <i>ein Haushammel</i>&mdash;it is what he likes
best.</p>

<p>We shall do nothing for his birthday. The chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_319" id="page_319">{319}</a></span>dren will recite
their poems and write little things, and his parents will come to

<p>How kind of you to remember our darling’s birthday; we both thank
you for this. Sad and many are our thoughts. I think of my
loneliness and anxiety when he was born, with Louis far away in the
midst of danger&mdash;a sad and awful time to come into the world; but
sweet Frittie was my comfort and occupation, a second son, a
pleasure to us both! Now all this is wiped out, and our parents’
hearts are sore, and asking for the dear bright face we miss so
much from amongst our circle of children! He ended his fight very
soon. May we all follow in a way as peaceful, with as little
struggle and pain, and leave an image of as much love and
brightness behind, to be a blessed remembrance for the rest of our
lives!</p>

<p>I can’t write on any other subject to-day, therefore close these

prefer living in the tapestry rooms this time. It won’t be like the
last time&mdash;though after our house here, so full of happy and

will take many a year to soften down, as you can understand.</p></div>

and will be a pleasure and satisfaction for me to look back to the

<p>Louis, who has always been so devoted to you, was touched to tears,
as I was, by your expressions of love to us and to our children.</p>

<p>Thank you also for all advice, which is so precious to me, and in
following it I shall like to think that I am doing something that
you told me.</p>

<p>How much I felt in parting from you I cannot say. Neither did I
like to speak of it, for it was too much, and the harder things in
life are better borne in silence, as none can bear them for one,
and they must be fought out by one’s self.</p>

<h3><a name="yr-1874" id="yr-1874">1874</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the first months of this year the Princess had the comfort of
seeing many of her relations. The year was chiefly spent in retirement,
and devoted to many sad memories. On the 24th of May she gave birth to a
daughter, whose christening took place on the 11th of July at Jugenheim,
near Darmstadt, in the presence of the Empress of Russia and the Duke of
Edinburgh. The child received the names of Marie Victoria Feodora
Leopoldine.</p>

<p>The hottest part of the summer was spent at Blankenberghe for the use of
sea-baths. In September the great manœuvres of the Eleventh Army Corps
took place in Upper Hesse, where the Princess met the Emperor of
Germany.</p>

<p>The Princess’ charitable institutions were all prospering, and assuming
larger and larger proportions; amongst them the Princess’ own hospital
was by degrees slowly approaching completion. It was the institution she
had the most at heart. It was intended to be a training-school for those
who intended to become nurses, and a home for probationers whose
training was at an end. It was also to serve as a model of those reforms
in sanitary arrangements which the Princess had so much at heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_322" id="page_322">{322}</a></span></p>

<p>When the provisional English hospital at Darmstadt (already mentioned
during the war in 1870) had been taken over by the Hessian authorities,
all its furniture, appointments, etc., were left to the “Alice Ladies’
Union” for the small hospital which it had started, aided by a small
body of doctors in Darmstadt. This was the origin of the “Alice
Hospital,” begun in a very small humble way in a cramped little house in
the Mauer-Strasse. The Frauen-Verein had undertaken, when the English
National Society for Aid to the Sick and Wounded had made over their
hospital to them, either to build quite a new one or thoroughly to
reorganize the existing one on the Mauer-Strasse. There were no funds to
build a new hospital; therefore the “Alice Ladies’ Union,” could only
resort to the other alternative, and this was carried out to the letter,
by additional buildings and a totally new arrangement of its interior.
As time went on, it was found advisable to give the hospital a distinct
administration, and to separate it from the “Alice Ladies’ Union,”
placing special funds at its disposal. This never would have come to
pass, nor would the hospital have proved the success it did, had it not
been for the untiring zeal, perseverance, economy, and practical
knowledge of the lady directing it. During the summer months of 1874, a
lady well acquainted with German and English hospitals&mdash;a trained nurse
herself&mdash;became Lady Superintendent of the training-school for nurses,
and of the hospital generally, which gradually, but surely, was gaining
in importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_323" id="page_323">{323}</a></span></p>

<p>The Alice Union for the Employment of Women made a further step in
advance during this year, and established itself on a firm broad basis
under the name of “The Alice Society for the Education and Employment of
Women of all Classes.” Of this the Princess was the President, whilst
Fräulein Louise Büchner directed the whole. The gentlemen and ladies who
formed the committee were chosen by the Princess. All worked most
harmoniously together; and the Princess was as anxious to receive advice
from others in matters concerning the society as she was glad to give it
herself.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;<i>How</i> low and miserable I am at times in these rooms,
particularly when I go to bed, I cannot tell you! The impression of
<i>all</i> is so vivid and heart-rending. I could cry out for pain

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I know well what your grief and your bereavement were
compared to mine; but they are such different sorrows, I don’t
think one can well compare them. Your life was broken&mdash;upset:
altered from the very roots, through the one you lost; my life is
unchanged, save in the mother’s heart the blank, the pain which
thousands of little things awaken&mdash;which by the world, even by the
family, are scarcely felt; and this ofttimes loneliness of
sentiment clouds one’s life over with a quiet sorrow which is felt
in <i>every thing</i>. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>On our dear Affie’s [Prince Alfred’s] wedding-day, a few tender
words. It must seem so strange to you not to be near him. My
thoughts are constantly with them all, and we have only the
<i>Times’</i> account, for no one writes here&mdash;they are all too busy,
and of course all news comes to you. What has Augusta [Lady Augusta
Stanley] written, and Vicky and Bertie? Any extracts or other
newspaper accounts but what we see would be most welcome.</p>

<p>We give a dinner to-night to the family and <i>entourage</i>, and
Russian and English legations. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Louis sends you his love and warmest wishes for yourself and the
happiness of the dear pair, in which I most earnestly join. God
bless and protect them, and may all turn out well!</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Dear Marie [the Duchess of Edinburgh] seems to make the same
impression on <i>all</i>. How glad I am she is so quite what I thought
and hoped. Such a wife must make Affie happy, and do him good, and
be a great pleasure to yourself, which I always like to think. I
shall read to my mother-in-law the letters, and show them to
Bäuerlein. Both will be very grateful for being allowed to see
them.</p>

<p>We are going from Saturday to Monday to Carlsruhe. The eldest girls
and Bäuerlein, who is going to take charge of them for a week, are
going with us.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;One day we have six degrees of heat, the next two or four of
cold; it is very unwholesome.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Carlsruhe</span>, February 2d.<br />

<p>I have a little time before breakfast to thank you so very much for
the enclosures, also the Dean’s [Stanley] letter through dear
Beatrice. We are most grateful for being allowed to hear these most
interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_325" id="page_325">{325}</a></span>ing reports! It brings every thing so much nearer. How
pleasant it is to receive only satisfactory reports! I fear Aunt
Marie is far from well. I should be very anxious, for she is like a
fading flower.</p>

<p>All the family, Hohenlohes and Holsteins, send their duty. All
their respective children and ours were together yesterday
afternoon. I hope not to seem vain, if it strikes me that amongst
all the children my girls usually carry away the palm. Victoria is
in such good looks at present; they are both natural and real
children, and as such I hope to be able to retain them long.</p>

<p>Sophie Weiss<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> came to see me yesterday. I was very glad to be
able to give her so good an account of you, and how young you
looked when I had that great happiness of those few short days at
Windsor, which did me good in <i>every</i> respect. Old Frau von Bunsen,
now eighty-three, I went to see&mdash;such a charming old lady, fresh in
her mind, with snow-white hair. You and Papa were the topic she
enjoyed speaking about, and our brothers and sisters.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;My nice Miss Graves I could so well have taken when Kitty
left, but I was so anxious for a German, though I was much inclined
toward her; I thought a German more important than it really is.
Not the nationality but the individuality is the first thing; and
here I think I have succeeded in finding the right person. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I hope you were not the worst for all your exertions. The
<i>Times’</i> accounts are charming. Such a warm reception must have
touched Marie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_326" id="page_326">{326}</a></span> and shown how the English cling to their Sovereign
and her house.</p>

<p>We have cold, snow, and dust, after quite warm weather. I trust you
will have sunshine to-morrow.</p>

<p>This last fortnight the news from Ashantee has so absorbed our
thoughts. It has been an arduous undertaking, and one’s heart warms
to our dear troops, who under all difficulties sustain their old
name for bravery and endurance. The poor 42d [Regiment] lost many
through illness, too; and I see they entered Coomassie playing the
bagpipes!</p>

<p>Louis is just reading to me Sir Hope Grant’s book on the Indian
Mutiny, which he kindly sent me, and which is interesting and
pleasant to read.</p>

<p>I am taking the first snowdrops to sweet Frittie’s grave. <i>How</i> the
first flowers he so dearly loved bring tears to my eyes, and
recollections which wring my heart anew! I dread these two next
months with their flowers and their birds. Good bye, darling Mama.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Surely Marie must feel it very deeply, for to leave so
delicate and loving a mother must seem almost wrong. How strange
this side of human nature always seems&mdash;leaving all you love most,
know best, owe all debts of gratitude to, for the comparatively
unknown! The lot of parents is indeed hard, and of such
self-sacrifice.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
April 11th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The children are too much an object here; they have too
little to compare with; they would be benefited by a change, seeing
other things and people, else they get into a groove, which I know
is not good. They are very unspoilt in their tastes, and simple and
quiet children, which I think of the greatest importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_327" id="page_327">{327}</a></span></p>

<p>Louis Battenberg has passed a first-rate examination. The parents
are so happy, and the influence the good conduct and steady work of
the elder brother has on the younger is of the greatest use, as
they wish to follow him, and be as well spoken of, and please their
parents, as he does. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>My best thanks for your dear letter of the 13th. You say rightly,
what a fault it is of parents to bring up their daughters with the
main object of marrying them. This is said to be a too prominent
feature in the modern English education of the higher classes. * *
* I want to strive to bring up the girls without <i>seeking</i> this as
the sole object for the future&mdash;to feel they can fill up their
lives so well otherwise. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;A marriage for the <i>sake</i> of
marriage is surely the greatest mistake a woman can make. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I
know what an absorbing feeling that of devotion to one’s parent is.
When I was at home, it filled my whole soul. It does still, in a
great degree, and <i>Heimweh</i> [homesickness] does not cease after
ever so long an absence. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, April 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I thought so much of your remarks about daughters, etc., and
do think it <i>so</i> natural and dutiful to remain with one’s parent as
long as one is wanted. Is it not a duty when no one else can take
one’s place? I should feel it so.</p></div>

<p>I thank you most tenderly for your loving wishes for my birthday,
received on getting up yesterday morning. You can understand that
the day was inexpressibly sad, that the fair head missing in our
circle was painfully felt, and that all these recollec<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_328" id="page_328">{328}</a></span>tions caused
me endless tears and heartache&mdash;though not for him, sweet precious
child.</p>

<p>As you say, life at best is a struggle; happy those who can lie
down to rest, having fought their battle well; or those who have
been spared fighting it at all, and have remained pure and
untouched, barely touching this earth, so mixed up with grief and
sin!</p>

<p>Let me thank you for the charming photographs, and for the present
toward the layette&mdash;a most kind assistance.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We went to the Mausoleum. The children had made me wreaths to
take there, and we all went together. How often and tenderly Ernie
speaks of Frittie! It is very touching, and speaks of his deep and
warm heart. He said the other day&mdash;for the recollection of death
has left such a deep impression, and he cannot reconcile it with
life, it pains him,&mdash;“When I die, you must die too, and all the
others; why can’t all die together? I don’t like to die alone, like
Frittie.” Poor child! the wish that <i>all</i> have, who love their own,
so early expressed. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>Many thanks for your last dear letter written on dear Arthur’s
birthday, of which, though late, I wish you joy. Such a good,
steady, excellent boy as he is! What a comfort it must be to you,
never to have had any cause of uneasiness or annoyance in his
conduct! He is so much respected, which for one so young is doubly
praiseworthy. From St. Petersburg, as from Vienna, we heard the
same account of the steady line he holds to, in spite of all
chaffing, etc., from others; which shows character.</p>

<p>My mother-in-law tells me that since Miechen has been allowed to
retain her religion, this right will of course be conceded to all
Princesses in future. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_329" id="page_329">{329}</a></span> a good thing, for the changing I always
thought too bad, and nowadays so intolerant and narrow. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To
think of Mr. Van de Weyer also leaving this world! To you he will
be a loss, and to all who knew him. Old friends are precious
landmarks in the history of one’s life, and not to be replaced by
new ones; and it is sad, how time reduces the number as one gets on
in life. How deeply you must feel this with each fresh loss! I feel
much for you. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Since 1867 the Emperor’s [of Russia] face shrank so, and he
became so thin. When I first saw him, in 1864, he was much stouter
and fresher looking. He has many cares, and one sees they weigh
upon him, for he is so kind and so well-meaning, and has done so
much to advance liberty and culture in his own country.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Mama</span>:&mdash;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The day (Whitsunday, and dear Frittie’s
burial-day) of baby’s birth would have been too sad, had not the
fact of its being your birthday given a double significance; but
when I heard those bells, and became conscious again of every

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Having no cow, or country place to keep one, in this
tremendous heat where one can’t keep milk, and dysentery carries
off so many babies, it would not be fair to deprive the poor little
thing of its natural and safest nourishment till the hot months<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_330" id="page_330">{330}</a></span>
are over. These, darling Mama, are my reasons, and though I do it
with such pleasure, yet it is not without sacrifices of comfort and
convenience, etc.; but it seems to me the best course to take for
our children, and as we are situated.</p>

<p>Many thanks for being baby’s godmother! It gives us great pleasure.</p>

<p>Do thank all our good people for their kind interest. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I am driving out this afternoon if cool enough. You must not tell
one of the heavenly Scotch air, when one is breathing heated stove
air; it makes one too envious.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
July 13th.<br />
</p>

<p>The christening went off very well. Baby looked really pretty for
so young an individual. It was in a large room. Marie [Duchess of
Edinburgh], quite in pink, held her godchild; and my mother-in-law,
with her best love, begs me to tell you, it had pleased her so much
that you had asked her to represent you. My three older girls
looked very nice, I thought, in lavender silk (your Christmas
present). I had the same color, and “Sunny” in pink, was immensely
admired. She is still improving in looks since you saw her.</p>

<p>I was glad it was another place, in different circumstances from
the last christening. As it was, it moved me much. The last time I
heard these words, darling Frittie was with us, and now the chain
has a gap!</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We can get nothing at Scheveningen except at exorbitant
prices, so we go to that dreadful Blankenberghe&mdash;without tree or
bush, nothing but a beach and sand banks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_331" id="page_331">{331}</a></span></p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Blankenberghe</span>, July 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>The sea air is doing all good, the children especially, the heat
had pulled them so.</p>

<p>I have bathed once, and hope it will agree. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;My cough and
relaxed throat are getting better.</p>

<p>The rooms are small and few, but clean, and the cooking good, and
we are quite satisfied. There is not a soul one knows.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Blankenberghe</span>, August 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>This day makes me think of our dear kind Grandmama, whose image
still dwells amongst us! None who ever knew her can forget how
truly lovable she was; and we grandchildren will ever retain such a
bright recollection of her. So many little attentions, small
souvenirs, kind letters, all tokens of affection <i>so</i> pleasing to
the receivers.</p>

<p>Yesterday Louis saved a lady from drowning. He was bathing. The
waves were high, and he heard a cry for help, and saw a bather
struggling. She had lost her footing. Her husband tried to help
her, but was exhausted and let her go; equally so the
brother-in-law, and Louis felt he was losing his strength, but she
kept her presence of mind and floated. He let her go once till a
wave brought her near him again, and he caught her hand and brought
her in, feeling quite done himself. I was not in the sea at the
time, for the waves were so tremendous that I lost my footing
several times, and had come out, fearing an accident. The lady is a
Mrs. T. Sligo, a Scotchwoman, and she has just written to me to
thank Louis. He is a good swimmer, and very strong. The gentlemen
are two grey-haired Scotchmen.</p>

<p>Ella has so wonderfully improved since she has been here. She is no
more pale and languid, and Ernie is another child also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_332" id="page_332">{332}</a></span></p>

<p>Luckily it has not been warm, so the air and baths are doubly
efficacious. They have done me a world of good. I feel quite
different to what I have done ever since Sunny’s birth. I believe
the sea to be the only thing for such a relaxed state, and, being
strong and healthy by nature, I can’t bear not being well, and
feeling so weak. Miss Graves has returned, but the girls have been
very good&mdash;no trouble at all.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, August 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>On dear Papa’s birthday I must send you a few lines. The past is
ever bright and vivid in my mind, though year after year
intervenes. How must it be for you, who live surrounded by such
precious recollections of the happy past!</p>

<p>I think doubly of you to-day, and doubly tenderly, sweet Mama!</p>

<p>I got home quite right, and found the house here cold. There was no
sun, and our rooms being to the north, and the wood so near, makes
them feel chilly.</p>

<p>I am glad dear Leopold bore the journey well. The air will do him
good in his weakened state.</p>

<p>The day at Laeken was quiet and pleasant. Marie is still thinner,
and more aged, I think. The loss of that nice boy weighs on them
still, and they spoke much about it, and she with many tears.</p>

<p>Every one has his burden to bear, and must bear it alone with trust
and resignation&mdash;that is the thing to struggle and to pray for.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, September 1st.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I shall get a comforter done for good Mrs. Brown, kind old
woman. I am glad she does not forget me, and shall be pleased to do
any little thing that can give her pleasure. Will you tell her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_333" id="page_333">{333}</a></span> the
plaid she made me still goes everywhere with me? How is Mrs. Grant?</p>

<p>Louis is gone, and I have a good deal to do every day. We breakfast
at half-past eight, then I have baby, and take the children out
till eleven. I then have business, baby, and, at one, the elder
girls alternately for French reading. After luncheon I write my
letters, etc., and before five go out. In the evenings I read, and
have supper at eight with the two ladies.</p>

<p>Ella is another child since she has been at the seaside&mdash;fine
color, no longer pale and languid, learns well, and is quite
different. Ernie the same, bright and fresh; while before they had
been looking pulled and weak, outgrowing their strength.</p>

<p>“Sunny” is the picture of robust health, and sweet little “sister
Maly” sits up quite alone, and is very neat and rosy, with such
quick eyes, and two deep dimples in her cheeks&mdash;a great pet, and so
like my poor Frittie.</p>

<p>The return here has been very painful, and days of great depression
still come, when I am tormented with the dreadful remembrance of
the day I lost him. Too cruel and agonizing are those thoughts. I
dwell on <i>his</i> rest and peace, and that our sufferings he cannot
know. What might not life have brought him? Better so! but hard to
say, “God’s will be done.”</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, September 15th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;’s conversion has created no smaller sensation with us
than elsewhere, and the <i>Times</i> criticised his step so sharply. It
remains a retrograde movement for any Protestant, how much more so
for a man of his stamp! Quite incomprehensible to me.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;This Catholic movement is <i>so un-English</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_334" id="page_334">{334}</a></span> I think, among
those Ritualists there are <i>bonâ fide</i> Catholics who help to
convert. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I will send you sweet little Maly’s photograph next time. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Baby has a very fair skin, light-brown hair and deep-blue eyes with
marked eyebrows, not much color in her cheeks, but pink and
healthy-looking altogether.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Kranichstein</span>, September 24th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;People with strong feelings and of nervous temperament, for
which one is no more responsible than for the color of one’s eyes,
have things to fight against and to put up with, unknown to those
of quiet, equable dispositions, who are free from violent emotions,
and have consequently no feeling of nerves&mdash;still less, of
irritable nerves. If I did not control mine as much as I could,
they would be dreadful. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;One can overcome a great deal&mdash;but
<i>alter</i> one’s self one cannot. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I always think, that in the end children educate the parents.
For their sakes there is so much one must do: one must forget one’s
self, if every thing is as it ought to be. It is doubly so, if one
has the misfortune to lose a precious child. Rückert’s lovely lines
are so true (after the loss of two of his children):</p>

<p>Yesterday Ernie was telling Orchard that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_335" id="page_335">{335}</a></span> going to plant some
Spanish chestnuts, and she said: “Oh, I shall be dead and gone
before they are big; what a pity we had none sooner!” and Ernie
burst out crying and said: “No, you must not die alone&mdash;I don’t
like people to die alone; we must die all together!” He has said
the same to me before, poor darling. After Lenchen’s [Princess
Christian’s] boys were gone, and he had seen Eddy and Georgy [sons
of the Prince of Wales], his own loss came fresh upon him, and he
cried for his little brother! It is the remaining behind the loss,
the missing of the dear ones, that is the cruel thing to bear. Only
time can teach one that, and resignation to a Higher Will. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, November 9th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The new Church laws (similar to the Prussian) go through our
Upper Chamber to-morrow, and will meet with great opposition. Louis
is, of course, for accepting them, as a check must be put on the
Catholics; for the Catholic clergy are paid by the State as well as
the Protestant, so that the State has an equal right over both; but
this right the Catholics have for years managed to evade. The
Bishop of Mayence is doing his utmost to create every possible
obstacle, but it is to be hoped that one will not here have to have
recourse to the method of fines and imprisonment as in Prussia * *

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>Many thanks for your dear letter, and for the advice, which, as a
mark of your interest in our children, is very precious, besides
being so good! What you mention I have never lost sight of, and
there is, as you say, nothing more injurious for children than that
they should be made a fuss about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_336" id="page_336">{336}</a></span> I want to make them unselfish,
unspoiled, and contented; as yet this is the case. That they take a
greater place in my life, than is often the case in <i>our</i> families,
comes from my not being able to have enough persons of a
responsible sort to take charge of them always; certain things
remain undone from that reason, if I do not do them, and <i>they</i>
would be the losers. I certainly do not belong by nature to those
women who are above all <i>wife</i>; but circumstances have forced me to
be the mother in the real sense, as in a private family, and I had
to school myself to it, I assure you, for many small self-denials
have been necessary. Baby-worship, or having the children
indiscriminately about one, is not at all the right thing, and a
perpetual talk about one’s children makes some women intolerable. I
hope I steer clear of these faults&mdash;at least I try to do so, for I
can only agree in <i>every</i> word you say, as does Louis, to whom I
read it; and he added when I was reading your remarks: “Das thust
Du aber nicht. Die Kinder und andere Menschen wissen gar nicht, was
Du für sie thust” [“But you don’t do so. Neither the children nor
anybody else knows what you do for them”]. He has often complained
that I would not have the children enough in my room, but, being of
your opinion, where it was not necessary, I thought it better not.

<p>I enclose a few lines to Mr. Martin.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> I have only had time to
look at the preface, and am very glad to hear that you are
satisfied.</p>

<p>With what interest shall I read it! You will receive these lines on
the 14th. Last year I had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_337" id="page_337">{337}</a></span> comfort of being near you. It did me
real good then, and I thank you again for those short and quiet
days, where the intercourse with you was so soothing to my aching
heart. There is no <i>Umgang</i> [intercourse] I know, that gives me
more happiness than when I can be with you&mdash;above all, in quiet.
The return to the so-called world I have barely made. Life is
serious&mdash;a journey to another end. The flowers God sends to
brighten our path I take with gratitude and enjoy; but much that
was dearest, most precious, which this day <i>commemorates</i>, is in
the grave; part of my heart is there too, though their spirits,
adored Papa’s, live on with me, the holiest and brightest part of
life, a star to lead us, were we but equal to following it! The
older I grow, the more perfect, the more touching and good, dear
Papa’s image stands before me. Such an <i>entire</i> life for duty, so
joyously and unpretendingly borne out, remains for all times
something inexpressibly fine and grand! With it how tender,
lovable, gay, he was! I can never talk of him to others who have
not known him, without tears in my eyes&mdash;as I have them now. He
<i>was</i> and <i>is</i> my ideal. I never knew a man fit to place beside
him, or so made to be devotedly loved and admired. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
December 14th.<br />
</p>

<p>Before this day is over, I must write a few words&mdash;my thoughts are
so much with you and with the past, the bright, happy past of my
childhood, where beloved Papa was the centre of this rich and happy
existence. I have spent nearly the whole day with the precious
volume which speaks so much of you and of him.</p>

<p><i>What</i> a man in every sense of the word; what a Prince he was&mdash;so
entirely what the dear old Baron<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_338" id="page_338">{338}</a></span> [Stockmar] urged him always to
be! Life with him must have seemed to you so secure and
well-guarded. How you must have loved him! It makes one’s heart
ache again and again, in reading and thinking of all dear Papa was
to you, that you should have had to part from him in the heat of
the day, when he was so necessary. <i>Ihm ist wohl</i> [With him it is
well]. A life like his was a whole long lifetime, though only
twenty-two years, and he well deserved his rest!</p>

<p>The hour is nearing when we last held and pressed his hand in life,
now thirteen years ago. How well I recollect that last sunrise, and
then the dreadful night with you that followed on that too awful
day! But it is not well to dwell on these things, when we have the
bright, sunny past to look back to. Tennyson’s beautiful
Dedication<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> expresses all one feels and would wish to say. I
can only add, with a heavy-drawn sigh, “Oh, to be worthier of
<i>such</i> a Father!” How far beneath him, if not always in aims, at
least in their fulfilment, have I always remained!</p></div>

<p>My best thanks for the letter of the 15th. Poor Colonel Grey’s<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
death is shocking, and Bertie and Alix are sure to have felt it
deeply. Dear Bertie’s true and constant heart suffers on such
occasions, for he can be constant in friendship, and all who serve
him serve him with warm attachment. I hope he won’t give way to the
idea of Sandringham being unlucky, though so much that has been
trying and sad has happened to them there! Superstition is surely a
thing to fight against; above all, with the feeling that all is in
God’s hands, not in ours!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_339" id="page_339">{339}</a></span></p>

<p>How interesting the book is [“Life of the Prince Consort”]! I have
finished it, and am <i>befriedigt</i> [satisfied]. It was a difficult
undertaking, but Mr. Martin seems to have done it very well.</p>

<p>I am sure dear Osborne is charming as ever, but I can’t think of
that large house so empty; no children any more; it must seem so
forsaken in our old wing. I have such a <i>Heimweh</i> [yearning] to see
Osborne again after more than six years. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<h3><a name="yr-1875" id="yr-1875">1875</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Each</span> year the Princess Alice endeavored by some public effort or
other&mdash;either a dramatic or musical performance&mdash;to collect funds for
her many charitable institutions which, as they extended their field of
usefulness, were more and more in need of pecuniary help. Artists as
well as amateurs gladly offered their services on all such occasions.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this year the Prince and Princess and their children
went to England for two months, spending part of the time with the
Queen, and part with the Prince and Princess of Wales. The two eldest
daughters, Victoria and Elizabeth, accompanied their grandmother to
Balmoral in May.</p>

<p>The whole family returned to Darmstadt at the end of June. In July the
Prince and Princess Louis were present at the “coming of age” of the
Hereditary Grand Duke of Baden. The rest of the summer was spent at
Kranichstein.</p>

<p>In 1874 the Hessian Government had amended their educational laws for
the schools, and had established, as a fundamental principle, that
needle-work<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_340" id="page_340">{340}</a></span> in all its branches should be taught in all girls’ schools,
and that suitable teachers for this purpose should be engaged. To meet
this necessity, a course of lectures and instruction in the art of
needle-work was instituted by the “Alice Society,” open to women and
girls of all classes. This has proved in its results of real blessing
and benefit to the whole country.</p>

<p>[The next two letters arose out of the expression of an opinion on the
part of some of the Prince Consort’s friends, that the publication of
his Life under the sanction of the Queen, with unreserved fulness of
details, had been premature.]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;It is touching and fine in you to allow the world to have so
much insight into your private life, and allow others to have what
has been only <i>your</i> property and our inheritance.</p>

<p>People can only be the better for reading about dear Papa, such as
he was, and such as so feelingly and delicately Mr. Theodore Martin
places him before them. To me the volume is inexpressibly precious,
and opens a field for thought in various senses.</p>

<p>For the frivolous higher classes how valuable this book will be, if
read with real attention, as a record of a life spent in the
highest aims, with the noblest conception of duty as a leading
star.</p></div>

<p>To this letter Her Majesty replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Osborne</span>, January 12, 1875.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Alice</span>:&mdash;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Now as regards the book. If you will reflect
a few minutes, you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_341" id="page_341">{341}</a></span> see how I owed it to beloved Papa to let
his noble character be known and understood, as it now is, and that
to wait longer, when those who knew him best&mdash;his own wife, and a
few (very few there are) remaining friends&mdash;were all gone, or too
old, and too far removed from that time, to be able to present a
really true picture of his most ideal and remarkable character,
would have been really wrong.</p>

<p>He must be known, for his own sake, for the good of England and of
his family, and of the world at large. Countless people write to
say, what good it does and will do. And it is already thirteen
years since he left us!</p>

<p>Then you must also remember, that endless false and untrue things
have been written and said about us, public and private, and that
in these days people will write and will know: therefore the only
way to counteract this is to let the real, full truth be known, and
as much be told as can be told with prudence and discretion, and
then, no harm, but good, will be done. Nothing will help me more,
than that my people should see what I have lost! Numbers of people
we knew have had their Lives and Memoirs published, and some
beautiful ones: Bunsen’s by his wife; Lord Elgin’s, by his (very
touching and interesting); Lord Palmerston’s; etc., etc.</p>

<p>“The Early Years” volume was begun for private circulation only,
and then General Grey and many of Papa’s friends and advisers
begged me to have it published. This was done. The work was most
popular and greatly liked. General Grey could not go on with it,
and asked me to ask Sir A. Helps to continue it, and he said that
he could not, but recommended Mr. Theodore Martin as one of the
most eminent writers of the day, and hoped I could pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_342" id="page_342">{342}</a></span>vail on him
to undertake this great national work. I did succeed, and he has
taken seven years to prepare the whole, supplied by me with every
letter and extract; and a deal of time it took, but I felt it would
be a national sacred work. You must, I think, see I am right now;
Papa and I too would have suffered otherwise. I think even the
German side of his character will be understood.</p>

<p>One of the things that pleases people most is the beautiful way in
which he took all good Stockmar’s often very severe observations.
And they also admire so much good old Stockmar’s honesty,
fearlessness, and are pleased to be shown what a dear warm-hearted
old man he was. Your devoted Mama,</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;The service in Dr. Weber’s study before the open coffin,
filled with flowers, was very affecting. He was truly beloved and
respected. His sufferings must have been intense, and for many
years borne heroically&mdash;not a word said; not a complaint; always
ready to bear the sorrows of others with them, yet bearing his own
unassisted! Wonderful self-command and unselfishness! He knew his
illness was fatal; even to the latter weeks considered his days as
but few, and put all in order, without letting his family and
friends know what he himself only too well foresaw.</p>

<p>It was a stormy afternoon with pouring rain when he was buried.
Louis, his poor boy, and many were out. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>You say of the drains just what I have said from year to year; and
this summer&mdash;if we can get away in the spring, when it is most
unwholesome&mdash;what can be done is to be done, and I hope with better
success than what has hitherto been attempted.</p>

<p>My little May cannot get rid of her cough, though she looks pink
and smiling. I shall be so glad to show her to you&mdash;she is so
pretty and dear.</p>

<p>My father-in-law has for the first time got the gout in his feet,
and is so depressed. Uncle Louis suffers dreadfully from oppression
at night, so that he can’t remain in bed. He is a good deal aged,
and stoops dreadfully. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>Louis gave me a dreadful fright last week by suddenly breaking
through the ice, and at a very deep place. He laid his arms over
the thicker ice, and managed to keep above water till some one was
near enough to help him out. He said the water drew immensely, and
he feared getting under the ice. The gentleman, who is very tall,
lay down and stretched his arms out to Louis, another man holding
the former: and so he got out without ill effects. As it was at
Kranichstein, he undressed and rubbed himself before the stove in
the Verwalter’s [land-steward’s] room; and he came home in the
Verwalter’s clothes, which looked very funny. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_344" id="page_344">{344}</a></span></p>

<p>I did not half thank you yesterday for our pleasant visit. I could
not trust myself to speak. I felt leaving you again so much. It has
been a great happiness to me, so <i>wohlthuend</i> [doing me so much
good] to have been with you, and I can never express what I feel,
as I would, nor how deep and tender my love and gratitude to you
are! The older I grow, the more precious the <i>Verhältniss</i>
[relation] to a mother becomes to me, and how doubly so to you!</p>

<p>Louis feels as I do; his love to you has always been as to his own
mother; and my tears begin to run when I recall your dear face and
voice, which to see and hear again has seemed so natural, so&mdash;as it
ought to be! that it is quite difficult to accustom myself to the
thought that only in memory can I enjoy them now.</p>

<p>How I do love you, sweet Mama! There is no sacrifice I would not
make for you! and as our meetings are of late years so fleeting and
far between, when they are over I feel the separation very much. *

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;All Victoria and Ella tell me of their stay at Balmoral&mdash;the

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We got home from Carlsruhe at eleven o’clock last night. We
went there on Thursday; arrived at two; were received there by
Fritz and Louise and the Emperor; found dear Marie Leiningen and
Hermann and Leopoldine there. Fritz W. arrived half an hour
afterwards from Vienna, having met with a railway accident in the
night; but he was, thank God, unhurt&mdash;barely shaken.</p>

<p>It was frightfully hot! Family dinner at five; then a drive about
the town, which was decked with flags. At nine in the evening a
large soirée and continual circle! and supper&mdash;<i>such</i> a heat! At
eight next morning in gala, church service. Fritz (son) for the
first time in uniform with the Black Eagle; then at ten a very fine
parade, in which Fritz marched past as second lieutenant with his
regiment. The troops were so fine; the Emperor led his own regiment
past, and it was a very moving sight, with a great deal of
cheering. At two there was a large banquet, at which Fritz made a
beautiful speech, and the Emperor a very good answer.</p>

<p>All Fritz’s (son) former school-fellows, and the different schools
and masters, came by in procession, and the day was very fatiguing.
He is such a good boy. His former tutor, who finished his task of
education yesterday, said to me: “Er ist ein <i>guter</i> Mensch und die
Wahrheit selber” [He is a good man, and truth itself]. He was very
self-possessed, modest, and civil, talking to every one. He is full
of promise, and has been carefully and lovingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_346" id="page_346">{346}</a></span> brought up by his
parents, who are such excellent people. I have the greatest regard
for them.</p>

<p>I told the Emperor the fright we had about the war. He was much
distressed, that any one could believe him capable of such a thing;
but our Fritz and Fritz of Baden agree that, with Bismarck, in
spite of the nation not wishing it, he might bring about a war at
any moment. Our Fritz spoke <i>so</i> justly and reasonably&mdash;quite
anti-war&mdash;and I told him all the opinions I had gathered and heard
in London; and he was much grieved and worried, I could see; but it
must and can be prevented, if <i>all</i> are against it, I am sure. This
enormous and splendid army, ready at any moment, is a dangerous
possession for any country. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To-day my eyes will not remain dry; the recollection of five
years ago, which brought us joy and promise of more in our sweet
second boy, is painful in the extreme. The sudden ending of that
young life; the gap this has left; the recollections that are now
but to be enjoyed in silent memory, will leave a heart-ache and a
sore place, beside where there is much happiness and cause for
gratitude. The six children and we, with endless flowers and tears,
decked his little grave this morning, and some sad lines of Byron’s
struck me as having much truth in the pain of such moments&mdash;</p>

<p>The weather is fine; it was much like this five years ago, but
round Metz it rained. Louis was turning into quarters with his
troops from a sortie, and he called the news out to the regiments
as he rode along, and they gave a cheer for their little Prince!</p>

<p>It was a dreadful time of trial and separation for both of us, and
Frittie was such a comfort and consolation to me in all my
loneliness.</p>

<p>How sorry I am for poor Alix at this long separation!<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> For her

<p>We hope to get back to our house by the 19th, though there will be
an end of nice walks for the next eight months&mdash;the town grows so,
and is all railroad and coal heaps where we had our walks formerly,
and the town pavement in the streets is most unpleasant walking. *

<p>For your dear letter and for the inclosures I am so grateful, but
distressed beyond measure at dear Fannie’s [Lady Frances Baillie].
I had a long letter from her some weeks back, when she was more
hopeful about dear Augusta [Stanley]. This is too much sorrow for
them all! Fannie I loved as a sister, and dear Augusta’s devotion
and self-sacrifice to you, and even to us in those dreadful years,
was something rare and beautiful. Her whole soul and heart were in
the duty, which to her was a sacred one. The good, excellent Dean!
My sympathy is so great with these three kind and good people so
sorely tried. I grieve for you too! God help them!</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> this new year brought no actual change to the usual routine of
the daily life in the Princess’ home, and although the Princess was able
to fulfil her social duties, traces of serious illness now began to show
themselves by repeated attacks of exhaustion and weakness. These attacks
were partially relieved by a short stay in the Black Forest in June, and
by a visit to England and Scotland, which she made without her husband.
The Prince had been detained in Germany by the great manœuvres, on the
conclusion of which he fetched her from England, in the autumn. On their
way back to Darmstadt they stopped at Brussels. They also visited
Coblenz, to pay their respects to the Empress of Germany, who had been

<p>No words can express how deep my sympathy and grief is for what our
dear Augusta and the Dean have to go through. With her warm, large
heart, which ever lived and suffered for others, how great must her

else lately, as you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_349" id="page_349">{349}</a></span> my love for Augusta, the General [her
brother, General Bruce], and Fanny has always been great; and when
I think back of them in former times, and in the year 1861, my
heart aches and my tears flow&mdash;feeling what you and we shall lose
in dear Augusta. My pity for the dear, good, kind Dean is so deep.
I sent him a few words again to-day, in the hope he may still say a

a beautiful dream; shall I tell you? I dreamt that I was dead and
was gone up to Heaven, and there I asked God to let me have Frittie
again; and he came to me and took my hand. You were in bed, and saw
a great light, and were so frightened, and I said, ‘It is Ernie and
Frittie.’ You were so astonished! The next night Frittie and I went
with a great light to sisters.” Is it not touching? He says such
beautiful things, and has such deep poetic thought, yet with it all
so full of fun and romping.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How sorry I am for good, kind old Mrs. Brown&mdash;to be blind
with old age seems so hard, so cruel; but I am sure with your so

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Yesterday, again, the Emperor Alexander spoke to me, really
rejoicing that the political complications were clearing
peacefully: “Dites à Maman encore une fois comme cela me réjouit,
et de savoir comme c’est elle qui tient à la paix. Nous ne pouvons,
nous ne voulons pas nous brouiller avec l’Angleterre. Il faudrait
être fou de penser à Constantinople ou aux Indes!” He had tears in
his eyes, and seemed so moved, as if a dreadful weight was being
lifted off; so happy for the sake of Marie, and Affie, too, that
matters were mending. He showed me after dinner the buttons you
gave him; spoke also so affectionately of Bertie. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I thought
of you&mdash;thirty-nine years of rule not to be envied, save for the
service one can render one’s country and the world in general in
such an arduous position.</p>

<p>Private individuals are, of course, far the best off&mdash;our
privileges being more duties than advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_351" id="page_351">{351}</a></span>&mdash;and their absence
would be no privation compared to the enormous advantage of being

able to know men and the world as they are, and not merely as they
please to show themselves to please us. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We dined with Uncle Louis, the Emperor, etc., and Grand Duke
of Weimar, at Seeheim yesterday. The Emperor said he had written to
you, but Prince Gortschakoff seemed only half-happy, and said to
me: “Franchement puis-je vous le dire, je désirerais voir
l’Angleterre grande, forte, décidée dans la politique, comme
l’était Canning et les grands hommes d’état que j’ai connus en
Angleterre il y a quarante ans. La Russie est grande et forte; que
l’Angleterre le soit aussi; nous n’avons pas besoin de faire
attention à tous les petits.” He said we made our foreign policy
and despatches for the Blue Book, and not an open decided policy
before the House of Commons and the world. It may interest you to
hear this opinion, as it shows the temper of his policy.</p></div>

<p>It is long since I have felt such pain as the death (to me really
sudden and unexpected, in spite of the danger inherent in her case)
of my good, devoted, kind Emily<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> has caused me. My tears won’t
cease. Louis, the children, the whole household, all mourn and
grieve with me. She was singularly beloved, and richly deserved to
be so! Her devotion and affection to me really knew no bounds. I
cannot think what it will be to miss her. I have <i>never</i> been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_352" id="page_352">{352}</a></span>
served as she served me, and probably never shall be so again. It
is a wrench that only those can estimate who knew her well&mdash;like
poor Mary Hardinge. She came first in Emily’s heart, and the loss
for her is quite, <small>QUITE</small> irreparable! Had I but seen dear Emily
again! This sudden, cruel sort of death shocks me so.</p>

<p>How I should have nursed and comforted her had I been near her! She
always wished this, and told me she had such a fear of death. There
never breathed a more unselfish, generous, good character.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I fear you will find me so dull, tired, and useless. I can do
next to nothing of late, and must rest so much. Poor Emily! My
thoughts never leave her. I cannot yet get accustomed to the
thought of her loss.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Just received your dear note. The accounts of my dear
Emily’s sad end have just reached me, and I am terribly upset. You
can hardly estimate the gap, the blank she will leave&mdash;my only
lady, and in many ways <i>homme d’affaires</i>. We had been so much
together this last waiting; every thing reminds me of her, and of
the touching love she bore me. Surely some years more she would
have lived.</p>

<p>Darling Mama, I don’t think you quite know how far from well I am,
and how absurdly wanting in strength. I only mention it, that you
should know that until the good air has set me up I am good for
next to nothing; and I fear I sha’n’t be able to come to dinner the
first evenings. I hope you won’t mind. I have never in my life been
like this before. I live on my sofa, and in the air, and see no
one, and yet go on losing strength! Of course this unexpected shock
has done me harm too, and has entailed more sad things. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_353" id="page_353">{353}</a></span></p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I hear Ernie is still so dull and melancholy at missing me;
he always feels it most, with that tender loving heart of his. God
preserve and guard this to me so inexpressibly precious child! I
fancy that seldom a mother and child so understood each other, and
loved each other, as we two do. It requires no words; he reads in
my eyes, as I do in his, what is in his little heart.</p>

<p>It is so wonderfully still here, not a soul in the streets. The
people of the house have sent up several times to enquire when and
to what church I was going; so I shall go, as it seems to shock
them, one’s staying away. I shall see the Monument this afternoon,
and go and see Holyrood again. The whole journey here brought back
with the well-remembered scenery the recollection of my childhood,
all the happy journeys with dear Papa and you. How the treasured
remembrance, with the deep love, lives on, when all else belongs to
the past!</p>

<p>I seem, in returning here, so near you and him in former happy
years, when my home was in this beloved country. No home in the
world can quite become what the home of one’s parents and childhood
was. There is a sacredness about it, a feeling of gratitude and
love for the great mercies one had there. You, who never left
country, <i>Geschwister</i> [kindred], or home, can scarcely enter into
this feeling.</p>

<p>In the hopes of meeting you soon, kissing your dear hands, with
thanks for all goodness, and many excuses for having caused so much
trouble. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>Let me thank you once more from my heart, darling Mama, for all
your great kindness, and for having enabled me to do what was
thought necessary and best. I return so much stronger and better
than I came, in every way&mdash;refreshed by the pleasant stay in dear
Balmoral with you, and then much better for the time here. I feel
morally refreshed, too, with the entire change, the many interests
to be met with here, which is always so beneficial, and will help
me in every way when I get back to Darmstadt. All this I have to
thank you for, and do so most warmly.</p>

<p>Louis, who, as you know, is full of love and affection for you, is
very grateful for your kind words, and has likewise derived profit
and enjoyment from his stay in England.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;My color and strength have so much returned, that I do not
doubt being well again this winter.</p>

do so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_355" id="page_355">{355}</a></span></p>

<p>Many thanks for your last letter from Balmoral, received yesterday
morning! I <i>know</i> you feel leaving the dear place, but without
going away there is no <i>Wiedersehen</i> [meeting again]. The happiness
of our meeting with the dear children was very great on all
sides&mdash;they eat me up!</p>

<p>They had made wreaths over the doors, and had no end of things to
tell me. We arrived at three, and there was not a moment’s rest
till they were all in bed, and I had heard the different prayers
and hymns of the six, with all the little different confidences
they had to make. My heart was full of joy and gratitude at being
with them once more, and I prayed God to make me fit to be their
real friend and stay as long as they require me, and to have the
insight into their different characters to guide them aright, and
to understand their different wants and feelings. This is so
difficult always.</p>

<p>Victoria is immensely grown, and her figure is forming. She is
changing so much&mdash;beginning to leave the child and grow into the
girl. I hear she has been good and desirous of doing what is right;
and she has more to contend with than Ella, therefore double merit
in any thing she overcomes, and any self-sacrifice she makes.</p>

<p>Ernie is very well, and his birthday was a great delight. Sweet
little May is enchanting,&mdash;“my <i>weet</i> heart,” as she calls me.
Aliky is very handsome and dear.</p></div>

forgotten! How deeply it is graven in my heart&mdash;with letters of
blood; for the pain of losing <i>him</i>, and of witnessing your grief,
was as sharp as any thing any child can go through for its beloved
parents. Yet God’s mercy is to be found through all, and one learns
to say “Thy will be done,” hard though it is. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<h3><a name="yr-1877" id="yr-1877">1877</a>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> health of Prince Charles of Hesse (father of Prince Louis) had for
some time past given cause for great anxiety. He had always suffered
from violent headaches and a delicate throat. On the evening of the 11th
of March he was seized with erysipelas, and died peacefully on the 20th.
The Princess shared the grief of her mother-in-law and family most
truly; for Prince Charles, though outwardly shy and retiring, was a man
of great cultivation and refinement, and had made himself beloved by all
who knew him. He was buried in the Mausoleum at the Rosenhöhe on the
24th of March. The Grand Duke, who was deeply affected by his brother’s
death, and all the family were present.</p>

<p>A month had scarcely passed since Prince Charles’ death, when the Grand
Duke himself was attacked by serious illness at Seeheim, one of his
summer residences, near Darmstadt, and died on the 13th of June at the
age of seventy-one.</p>

<p>Prince Louis was the next heir, and ascended the throne as Grand Duke
Louis IV.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_357" id="page_357">{357}</a></span></p>

<p>The total change of circumstances, the heavy duties and responsibilities
of her new position, came most unexpectedly upon the Princess, and she
scarcely felt herself equal to them. With her well-known
conscientiousness and high feeling of duty it was not surprising that
they weighed heavily upon her, more especially as her health had of late
become very delicate. Still, the hope of being able to carry out many a
plan for the welfare of her adopted country encouraged her greatly.</p>

<p>After the official receptions held by the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess
were over, they left Darmstadt for the quiet little watering-place of
Houlgate, in Normandy. The Grand Duke was only able to accompany the
Grand Duchess as far as Metz, but he followed her later on with the
children. The rest and quiet were good for them all; and, apparently
much improved in health, the Grand Duchess returned for the first time
as “mother of the country” [<i>Landesmutter</i>] to Darmstadt. Her reception
was of the warmest and most enthusiastic nature, which she took as a
good omen for the future.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Germany and the Crown Prince visited Darmstadt at the end
of September, for the purpose of assisting at the cavalry manœuvres, to
the great satisfaction of the country.</p>

<p>The change in Princess Alice’s position in no wise affected her
relations to her many charitable institutions, though she had, of
course, many new responsibilities thrown upon her. Her constant
endeavor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_358" id="page_358">{358}</a></span> was to be just and free from prejudice, to recognize what was
good, no matter where, and to promote and further it to the best of her
power.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke and Grand Duchess saw much of the Crown Prince and Crown
Princess of Germany during the latter part of the year, as they were
living at Wiesbaden.</p>

<p>Fräulein Louise Büchner, who had been for ten years so intimately
connected with the Grand Duchess, not only as working with her for the
good of others, but also by ties of the truest friendship, died on the
28th of November. Her death caused a gap which was sorely felt. A few
days before her death, when she was already confined to her bed, she
received a letter from the Grand Duchess herself, on the occasion of the
tenth anniversary of the opening of the “Alice Bazaar,” thanking her for
all she had done.</p>

<p>The Grand Duchess had caused many of the pamphlets written by Miss
Octavia Hill to be translated, in the hopes of encouraging in Darmstadt
the authorities, and those at the head of private undertakings, to
further exertions for improving the condition of the poor.</p>

<p>Whilst in England she had become acquainted with Miss Octavia Hill, “the
warm-hearted friend of the poor,” and had visited with her many of the
poorer parts of London. She felt the sincerest admiration and respect
for Miss Hill, and entirely shared her view, “that we must become the
friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_359" id="page_359">{359}</a></span> of the poor to be their benefactors.” The Grand Duchess did not
wish to copy exactly in Germany what Miss Hill had done in London: but
she hoped that the knowledge of what had been done in other places would
be an incentive to work in the same direction.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this year the Grand Duchess had visited in strictest
incognito the worst houses (in sanitary respects) in Mayence, and
determined to make a plan for the erection of new dwellings for the
working classes there.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;How beautifully Max Müller’s letter<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> is written and
expressed, and how touchingly and truly he puts the point of view
on which we all should learn to stand. To become again pure as
children, with a child’s faith and trust&mdash;there where our human
intellect will <i>ever</i> stand still!</p>

<p>I have been reading some of Robertson’s sermons again, and I think
his view of Christianity one of the truest, warmest, and most
beautiful I know. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, March 23d.<br />
</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your dear and sympathizing letter. These have
been most painful&mdash;most distressing days&mdash;so harrowing.</p>

<p>The recollections of 1861, of dear Frittie’s death, when my dear
father-in-law was so tender and kind, were painfully vivid. My
mother-in-law’s resignation and touching goodness, doing all that
she could during the illness and since for all arrangements, is
very beautiful!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_360" id="page_360">{360}</a></span></p>

<p>The poor sons gave way to bursts of tears during those agonizing
hours; yet they held their father alternately with me, and were
quiet and helpful for their mother and for him, just as their
simple, quiet natures teach them. I begged Bäuerlein to write to
you meanwhile. I am feeling so exhausted, and there is so much to
do, and we are always going from one house to the other.</p>

<p>It was heart-rending from Monday morn till Tuesday eve to see the
painful alteration in the dear well-known features augmenting from
hour to hour, though I believe he did not suffer latterly. He was
not conscious, unless spoken to, or called very directly.</p>

<p>My mother-in-law never left his bedside day or night, and we were
only a few hours absent on Monday night. Before we went home she
called our names distinctly to him as we kissed him, and he seemed
to notice it; then she knelt down, and distinctly, but choked with
tears, prayed the Lord’s Prayer for him, calling him gently.</p>

<p>The next day at six we were there again, and till half past six in
the evening never left the bedside. She repeated occasionally, as
long as she thought he might hear, a short verse&mdash;<i>so</i> touching!
and once said: “Bist Du traurig? es ist ja nicht auf lange, dann
sind wir wieder zusammen!” [“Art thou sad? It is not for long, and
then we shall be together again”] kissing and stroking his hands.
It was very distressing.</p>

<p>When all was over we four were close to her, and she threw herself
on him, and then clasped her sons to her heart with words of such
grief as you so well understand!</p>

<p>Early the next morning we went with her to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_361" id="page_361">{361}</a></span> room. He lay on his
bed, very peaceful, in his uniform. Louis had clasped the hands
together when he died, and I arranged flowers on the bed and in the
room round him.</p>

<p>There is a terrible deal to do and to arrange, and many people
come, and we are much with my poor mother-in-law. Yesterday we went
for the last time to see the remains of what had been so precious.
She read a “Lied” [a hymn], and then kissed him so long, and took
with us the last look. Yesterday evening the coffin was closed in
presence of the sons.</p>

<p>We are going to the Rosenhöhe [the Mausoleum] now, before going to
Louis’ mother, to put things straight there, and see if one can get
by dear Frittie&mdash;it is <i>so</i> small.</p>

<p>The three brothers are dreadfully upset, but able to arrange and
see after what is necessary. Aunt Marie [the Empress of Russia]
wanted to come, and is in terrible distress; she loved that brother
beyond any thing. In her last letter to my mother-in-law she says:
“Ich habe solche Sehnsucht nach dem alten Bruder” [“I have such a
yearning after my old brother”].</p>

<p>His was a singularly delicate-minded, pure, true, unselfish nature,
so full of consideration for others, so kind. My tears flow
incessantly, for I loved him very dearly.</p>

<p>My dear mother-in-law has such a broken, ruined existence now&mdash;all
turned round him! She knows where to find strength and comfort&mdash;it
will not fail her. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, June 7th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;We are going through a dreadful ordeal. The whole of Monday
and Monday night, with a heat beyond words, dreading the worst. Now
there<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_362" id="page_362">{362}</a></span> has been a slight rally.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Whether it will continue
to-morrow is doubtful. He is always conscious, makes his little
jokes, but the pulse is very low and intermits. I was there early
this morning with Louis. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The questions, long discussions between Louis and some people, as
to complication and difficulty of every kind that will at once fall
upon us, are really dreadful, and I so unfit just now! The
confusion will be dreadful. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I am so dreading every thing, and above all the responsibility of
being the first in every thing, and people are not <i>bienveillant</i>.</p>

<p>I shall send you news whenever I can, but I am so worn out. I shall
not be able to do so much myself.</p>

<p>I know your thoughts and wishes are with us at so hard a time. God
grant we may do all aright! *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<p>Only two words of thanks from both of us for your kind wishes and
letters! Christian and Colonel Gardiner bring you news of every
thing that has been and is still going on. But we are overwhelmed,
over-tired, and the heat is getting very bad again.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Will tell you what a very difficult position we are in. It is
too dreadful to think that I am forced to leave Louis in a few
weeks under present circumstances, but, if he wishes to keep me at
all, I must leave every thing and this heat for a time. These next
weeks here will be very anxious and difficult. God grant we may do
the right things!</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
June 28th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;To have to go away just now, when the refreshment of family
life is so doubly pleasant to Louis after his work, I am too sorry
for. If I were only better; if I only thought that I shall have the
chance of rest, and what is necessary to regain my health! Now it
will be more difficult than ever, and I see Louis has the fear,
which I also have, that I shall not hold out very long.</p></div>

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I leave on Tuesday, but stop on the way. The children go
direct and join me in Paris, when we go on together on Friday or
Saturday to Houlgate. The trains don’t fit, and one has some way to
drive from Trouville.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Houlgate</span>, July 25th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;This place is quite charming&mdash;real<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_364" id="page_364">{364}</a></span> country, so green, so
picturesque&mdash;a beautiful coast; the nicest sea-place I have been at
yet. Our house is “wee” for so many, and the first days it was very
noisy; and it was so dirty. The maids and nurses had to scrub and
sweep; the one French housemaid was not up to it. All is better
now, and quite comfortable enough. The air is doing me good, and
the complete change. I have bathed twice, and the sea revives me.</p>

<p>I follow as eagerly as any in England the advance of the Russians,
and with cordial dislike. <i>They</i> can never be redressers of wrongs
or promoters of civilization and Christianity. What I fear is, even
if they don’t take Constantinople, and make no large demands as the
price of their victories now, the declaration of the independence
of Bulgaria will make that country to them in future what Roumania
has been for Russia now, and therefore in twenty years hence they
will get all they want, unless the other Powers at this late hour
can bring about a change. It is bad for England, for Austria, for
Germany, if this Russian Slav element should preponderate in
Europe; and the other countries must sooner or later act against
this in self-preservation.</p>

<p>What do the friends of the “Atrocity Meetings” say now? How
difficult it has been made for the Government through them, and how
blind they have been! All this must be a constant worry and anxiety
for you!</p>

<p>The children are so happy here&mdash;the sea does them such good. I am
very glad I brought them.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Houlgate</span>, July 28th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Though we have rain off and on, still the weather is very
pleasant, and we are all of us charmed with the place, and the
beautiful, pictu<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_365" id="page_365">{365}</a></span>resque, fertile country. The life is so
pleasant&mdash;real country&mdash;which I have never yet found at any
bathing-place abroad yet. I have bathed every other day&mdash;swim, and
it does me good. I feel it already. Ella is getting her color back,
and the little ones look much better.</p>

<p>I send you the last photos done of the children; Ella’s is not
favorable, nor Irène’s, but all in all they are a pretty set. May
has not such fat cheeks in reality; still it is very dear. The two
little girlies are so sweet, so dear, merry, and nice. I don’t know
which is dearest, they are both so captivating.</p>

<p>I have been to an old tumble-down church at Dives&mdash;close by
here&mdash;where William the Conqueror is said to have been before
starting for England. His name and those of all his followers are
inscribed there&mdash;names of so many families now existing in England.
It was very interesting.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I must tell you now, how very heartily and enthusiastically
the whole population, high and low, received us yesterday. It was
entirely spontaneous, and, as such, of course, so very pleasing. *
* * I was really touched, for it rained, and yet all were so
joyous&mdash;flags out, bells ringing, people bombarding us with
beautiful nosegays; all the schools out, even the higher ones, the
girls all dressed in white. The Kriegerverein, Louis’ old soldiers,
singing, etc. In the evening all the Gesang<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_366" id="page_366">{366}</a></span>vereine joined together
and sang under our windows.</p>

<p>We are very glad to be at home again, and, please God, with earnest
will and thought for others, we together shall in our different
ways be able to live for the good of the people entrusted to our
care! May God’s blessing rest on our joint endeavors to do the
best, and may we meet with kindness and forbearance where we fall
short of our duties.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, October 30th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I had to receive sixty-five ladies&mdash;amongst them my
nurses&mdash;and some doctors from here and other towns, all belonging
to my Nursing Society, which has now existed ten years. Then I was
at the opening of my Industrial Girls’ School, where girls from all
parts of the country come, and which is a great success. I started
it two years ago. On Sunday I took the children to hear the
Sunday-school, which interested them very much.</p>

<p>I have been doing too much lately, though, and my nerves are
beginning to feel the strain, for sleep and appetite are no longer
good. Too much is demanded of one; and I have to do with so many
things. It is more than my strength can stand in the long run. * *

<p>For to-morrow, as ever, my tenderest sympathy! Time shows but more
and more what we all lost in beloved Papa; and the older I grow,
the more people I know, the more the remembrance of him shines
bright as a star of purer lustre than any I have ever known. May
but a small share of his light fall on some of us, who have
remained so far beneath him, so little worthy of such a father! We
can but admire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_367" id="page_367">{367}</a></span> reverence, long to imitate, and yet not approach
near to what he was.</p>

<p>We are going with the children to-day to Wiesbaden until Saturday;
and I mean to tell Vicky that she had better give up the hope of my
being able to come for the wedding.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> I could not do it. I only
trust the why will be understood. Do write to the dear Empress
about it when next you write. <i>How</i> sorry I am to be absent at a
moment when, as sister and a German Sovereign’s wife, I should be
there; but the doctor would not hear of it, so I gave it up. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;You say all that happened after the dreadful 14th is effaced
from your memory. How well I can imagine that! I remember saying my
utmost to Sir Charles Phipps in remonstrance to your being wished
to leave Windsor&mdash;it was so cruel, so very wrong. Uncle Leopold
insisted; it all came from him, and he was alarmed lest you should
fall ill.</p>

<p><i>How</i> you suffered was dreadful to witness; never shall I forget
what I went through for you then; it tore my heart in pieces; and
my own grief was so great too. Louis thought I would not hold to my
engagement then any more&mdash;for my heart was too filled with beloved,
adored Papa, and with your anguish, to have room or wish for other
thoughts.</p>

<p>God is very merciful in letting time temper the sharpness of one’s
grief, and letting sorrow find its natural place in our hearts,
without withdrawing us from life!</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_368" id="page_368">{368}</a></span></p>

 THE END.<br /><br />
1878.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="sml">“Life is serious&mdash;a journey to another end.” (<i>December 12, 1874.</i>)</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE state of the Grand Duchess’ health prevented her from accompanying
the Grand Duke to Berlin on the occasion of the marriages of Princess
Charlotte of Prussia (eldest daughter of the Crown Prince and Princess
of Germany) to the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, and of Princess
Elizabeth of Prussia (sister to the Duchess of Connaught) to the
Hereditary Grand Duke of Oldenburg. Although she was unable to go out
much into society, or to take an active part in social gayeties, her
interest and sympathy were unabated, particularly in all matters
concerning art and science. She received many guests, and Prince William
of Prussia (then studying at Bonn) often visited her.</p>

<p>The celebrated portrait painter Heinrich von Angeli came to Darmstadt in
the spring to paint a family picture of the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess
and their children by command of the Queen of England. Princess Alice
greatly enjoyed his acquaintance, and was charmed as well by his musical
talent as by his wonderful genius in painting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_369" id="page_369">{369}</a></span> Angeli’s picture of
Princess Alice was the last ever painted of her.</p>

<p>The repeated attempts on the life of the old Emperor of Germany affected
the Grand Duchess very nearly, as from her childhood she had ever been
greatly attached to him.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke and Grand Duchess with their children spent the summer
months of this year at Eastbourne. Sea-bathing and sea-air had again
been recommended as necessary.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke had to return to Darmstadt soon after their arrival at
Eastbourne, but toward the end of the stay there he rejoined them.</p>

<p>The whole family visited the Queen at Osborne.</p>

<p>Although the Grand Duchess had, during all her former visits to England,
shown her lively personal interest in all charitable institutions in
London, visiting many herself, she seems on the occasion of this, her
last, visit to her beloved native land, to have taken a more than
ordinary interest in these matters, and to have also gone minutely into
the subject of the exertions which were being made to relieve the
pressing wants of the poor.</p>

<p>The Grand Duchess had scarcely arrived at Eastbourne (an eye-witness
tells us), when she at once made enquiries as to the condition of the
poorer parts of that town, and determined to visit them herself. She
loved to wander about that part of Eastbourne which is inhabited by the
fishing population. She often entered their cottages, visiting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_370" id="page_370">{370}</a></span>
sick, and showing her sympathy to all. The visits to the Sunday-school
were a great pleasure to her. The Princess often remarked, “How much
good such instruction must do!”</p>

<p>She attended divine service at a church some little way off, not because
the service was particularly attractive, but because the church and its
congregation needed support and help.</p>

<p>Amongst those good works which from year to year had specially occupied
her were the Refuges and Penitentiaries for those poor women and girls
who most need our help. Much had been done in this way in England, and
the Albion Home at Brighton, founded and managed solely by Mrs. Murray
Vicars, had proved of the greatest service and blessing. The Grand
Duchess invited Mrs. Vicars to come and see her at Eastbourne, and tell
herself about her work, and showed her, when she came, the greatest
sympathy and kindness, entering with the warmest interest into all
details of the working of the Home.</p>

<p>Before leaving Eastbourne the Grand Duchess went incognita to Brighton,
and paid a private visit to the Albion Home. “I only come as one woman
to visit another” were the Princess Alice’s own words, when Mrs. Vicars
begged her to be allowed to tell the poor Penitents who their visitor
was.</p>

<p>The Grand Duchess was greatly impressed, after her visit to the Home, by
Mrs. Vicars’ wonderful power and practical knowledge, and by her
gentle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_371" id="page_371">{371}</a></span> loving way toward those poor girls; and this in a great measure
induced her, with the Grand Duke’s consent, to become Patroness of the
Albion Home. At first, when asked by Mrs. Vicars to become the
Patroness, she had refused to do so; but, having reconsidered the
subject, she wrote to her the following letter from Darmstadt:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">New Palace, Darmstadt.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Vicars</span>:&mdash;I have returned from visiting the Home so
convinced of your excellent management of it in every respect,
that, if you still feel my becoming Patroness of the Home (and of
the Ladies’ Association connected with it) can further the good and
noble work, I am most willing to comply with your request. The
spirit of true, loving, Christian sympathy in which the work was
begun by you, and with which it is carried out; the cheerfulness
you impart, the motherly solicitude you offer to those struggling
to return to a better life, cannot fail to restore in a great
measure that feeling of self-respect so necessary to those
voluntarily seeking once more a virtuous life, and by so doing
regaining the respect of their fellow-creatures. “Inasmuch as ye
have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have
done it unto Me.” In this spirit may the Home, as well as the
Association connected with it, continue its good work. My entire
sympathy and good wishes will ever be with it.</p>

<p class="r"><span style="margin-right: 2em;">
Ever yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Alice</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>After the Grand Duchess’ return to Darmstadt, she devoted herself with
redoubled energy to all her charitable institutions; but, alas! she felt
more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_372" id="page_372">{372}</a></span> more that her bodily strength was no longer equal to her
exertions.</p>

<p>In the autumn she had the happiness of seeing several of her family at
Darmstadt, the last of them being her brother, Prince Leopold.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
Darmstadt, January 26th.<br />
</p>

<p>Though I have no letter, and expect none at such a moment, still I
must send you a few lines to tell you how constantly I think of
you, and of my own beloved and adored country. The anxiety you must
be going through, and the feelings you must experience, I share
with my whole heart. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>God grant it may be possible to do the right thing, for it is late,
and the complication is dreadful!</p>

<p>I have barely any thoughts for any thing else; and the Opposition
seems to me to have been more wrong in its country’s interest, and
to have done her a greater harm than can ever be redressed. It is a
serious, awful moment for Sovereign, country, and Government; and
in your position none have to go through what you have&mdash;and after
all so alone!</p>

<p>I hope your health bears up under the anxiety.</p></div>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Angeli has arrived, and will begin at once. We thought Ernie
and Ella&mdash;Victoria is too big, though she is the eldest and ought
to be in the picture; she would be too preponderant. Angeli is
quite lost in admiration of Aliky and May, who are, I must say
myself, such a lovely little pair as one does not often see. He
will begin our heads to-morrow. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">

</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;I am but very middling, and leading a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_373" id="page_373">{373}</a></span> very quiet life, which
is an absolute necessity. It is so depressing to be like this. But
our home life is always pleasant&mdash;never dull, however quiet. Only a
feeling of weariness and incapacity is in itself a trial.</p></div>

<p>On the 8th of November Princess Victoria was suddenly attacked with
diphtheria. How and where she caught the illness remains unexplained.
The Grand Duchess, always so courageous in illness, and fearing none,
had, however, always had a great horror of diphtheria. Princess Victoria
was at once isolated from her family and the others in the house; but,
alas! to no purpose. Princess Alice superintended the nursing, aided by
the nurses and the Lady Superintendent of her hospital. The terrible
anxiety of the poor mother during that illness is best described by her
own telegrams and letters to the Queen.</p>

<h3><i>Telegrams.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
<span class="smcap">Darmstadt</span>, November 12th.<br />
</p>

<p>This is dreadful! my sweet, precious Aliky so ill! At three this
morning Orchie called me, saying she thought the child was
feverish; complaining of her throat. I went over to her, looked
into her throat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_374" id="page_374">{374}</a></span> and there were not only spots, but a thick
covering on each side of her throat of that horrid white membrane.
I got the steam inhaler, with chlorate of potash for her at once,
but she was very unhappy, poor little thing. We sent for the
doctor, who lives close by, and who saw at once that it was a
severe case. We have put her upstairs near Victoria, who is quite
convalescent, and have fumigated the nursery to try and spare May
and the others. It is a <i>terrible</i> anxiety; it is such an acute,
and often fatal, illness. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Victoria has been graciously
preserved; may God preserve these [the younger ones] also in His
mercy! My heart is sore; and I am so anxious.</p></div>

<p>Aliky tolerable. Darling May very ill; fever so high. Irène has got
it too. I am miserable; such fear for the sweet little one!</p></div>

<p>On the 14th of November Prince Ernest and the Grand Duke were attacked
with diphtheria, so that, up to that time, Princess Elizabeth only had
escaped the infection. She was sent to her Grandmother’s, Princess
Charles of Hesse’s palace.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Telegram.</i></p>

</p>

<p>My precious May no better; suffers so much. I am in such horrible
fear. Irène and Ernie fever less. Ernie’s throat very swelled.
Louis no worse; almost no spots. Aliky recovering.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
Evening.<br />
</p>

<p>Darling May’s state unchanged; heart-rending. Louis’ fever and
illness on the increase. The others, as one could expect; all
severe cases. May’s most alarming.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_375" id="page_375">{375}</a></span></p>

<p>The sympathy with the Grand Duchess in her great anxiety was universal.
In many of the churches special services were held, praying for the
recovery of that dearly beloved family. The well-known suffering state
of the Grand Duchess’ own health, so sorely tried at this moment, caused
the gravest fears to be entertained on her own account.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th of November sweet little Princess “May”&mdash;the
Princess’ sunshine, as she ever called her&mdash;was taken from her doting
parents. The Grand Duchess telegraphed as follows to her mother:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 16th.<br />
</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Our sweet little one is taken. Broke it to my poor Louis this
morning; he is better; Ernie very, very ill. In great anguish.</p></div>

<h3><i>Telegrams.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 16th; evening.<br />
</p>

<p>The pain is beyond words, but “God’s will be done!” Our precious
Ernie is still a source of such terrible fear. The others, though
not safe, better.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 17th.<br />
</p>

<p>Ernie decidedly better; full of gratitude.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 18th.<br />
</p>

<p>My patients getting better; hope soon to have them better. Last
painful parting at three o’clock.</p></div>

<p>The coffin had to be closed very soon. It was entirely covered with
flowers. The Grand Duchess quietly entered the room where it had been
placed. She knelt down near it, pressing a corner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_376" id="page_376">{376}</a></span> pall to her
lips; then she rose, and the funeral service began.</p>

<p>When it was over, she cast one long, loving look at the coffin which hid
her darling from her. She then left the room and slowly walked
up-stairs. At the top of the stairs she knelt down, and taking hold of
the golden balustrade, looked into the mirror opposite to her to watch
the little coffin being taken out of the house. She was marvellously
calm; only long-drawn sighs escaped her.</p>

<p>When all had left the palace, she went to the Grand Duke, who was to be
kept in ignorance of all that was going on. The Grand Duchess had
herself arranged every detail of the funeral.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Telegram.</i></p>

<p class="r">
November 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>The continued suspense almost beyond endurance. Ernie thought he
was going to die in the night, and was in a dreadful state for some
hours. Louis very nervous, too; but they are not worse. The six
cases have been one worse than the other.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
Later, November 19th.<br />
</p>

<p>Ernie had a relapse, and our fears are increased. I am in an agony
between hope and fear.</p></div>

<p>The Grand Duchess desired her warmest thanks to be expressed to the
country for their heart-felt sympathy.</p>

<p>On the 25th of November the Grand Duke was able for the first time to
leave his bed for a few hours, and on the 6th of December he and Prince
Ernest drove out for the first time, in a shut carriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_377" id="page_377">{377}</a></span></p>

<p>It was on this day that the Grand Duchess wrote for the last time to the
Queen.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 19th.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Mama</span>:&mdash;Tender thanks for your dear, dear letter, soothing
and comforting!</p>

<p>Our sweet May waits for us up there, and is not going through our
agony, thank God! Her bright, happy, sunshiny existence has been a
bright spot in our lives&mdash;but oh! how short! I don’t touch on the
anguish that fills me, for God in His mercy helps me, and it must
be borne; but to-day, again, the fear and anxiety for Ernie is
still greater. This is quite agonizing to me; <i>how</i> I pray that he
may be spared to me!</p>

<p>His voice is so thick; new membranes have appeared. He cries at
times so bitterly, but he is gayer just now.</p>

<p>To a mother’s heart, who would spare her children every pain, to
have to witness what I have, and am still doing, knowing all these
precious lives hanging on a thread, is an agony barely to be
conceived, save by those who have gone through it.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Your letter says so truly all I feel. I can but say, in all
one’s agony there is a mercy and a peace of God, which even now He
has let me feel. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I mean to try and drive a little this afternoon. I shall go
out with Orchie. Of my six children, since a week none more about
me, and not my husband. It is like a very awful dream to me.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="r">
November 22d.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Mama</span>:&mdash;Many thanks for your dear letter, and for all the
expressions of sympathy shown by so many! I am <i>very</i> grateful for
it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_378" id="page_378">{378}</a></span></p>

<p>Dear Ernie having been preserved through the greatest danger is a
source of such gratitude! These have been terrible days! He sent a
book to May this morning. It made me almost sick to smile at the
dear boy. But he must be spared yet awhile what to him will be such
a sorrow.</p>

<p>For myself, darling Mama, God has given me comfort and help in all
this trouble, and I am sure His Spirit will remain near us in the
trials to come! Great sympathy, such as all show, is a balm; but I
am very tired, and the pain is often very great; but pain can be
turned into a blessing, and I pray this may be so. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>When alone, I rest; and writing even is a physical exertion. Those
around me have spared me all they could, but one must bear the
greater weight one’s self.</p>

<p>May God spare you all future sorrow, and give you the peace which
He alone can give!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I finish these lines at my dear Louis’ bed. He thanks you so
much for your dear, loving sympathy. Thank God, he is doing well.
But the pain they have all gone through in their poor throats has
been <i>awful</i>. The doctors and nurses&mdash;eight! for they have changed
day and night, and had such constant attendance&mdash;have been <i>all</i> I
could wish.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;Every one shows great sympathy, I hear, everywhere. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;All
classes have shown a great attachment to us personally, and to the
House, and amongst the common people&mdash;it goes home to them that our
position does not separate us so very far from them, and that in
death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_379" id="page_379">{379}</a></span> danger, and sorrow the palace and the hut are visited
alike.</p>

<p>So many deep and solemn lessons one learns in these times, and I
believe all works together for good for those who believe in God. *

<p>So many pangs and pains come, and must yet for years to come. Still
gratitude for those left is <i>so</i> strong, and indeed resignation
entire and complete to a higher will; and so we all feel together,
and encourage each other. Life is <i>not</i> endless in this world, God
be praised! There is much joy&mdash;but oh! so much trial and pain; and,
as the number of those one loves increases in Heaven, it makes our
passage easier&mdash;and <i>home</i> is there!</p>

<p>Louis and Ernie will go out in a shut carriage to-day, though it
rains&mdash;but it is warm. Louis’ strength returns <i>so</i> slowly. Of
course he shuns the return to life, where our loss will be more
realized; to him, shut off so long, it is more like a dream. I am
so thankful they were all spared the dreadful realities I went
through&mdash;and alone. My cup seemed very full, and yet I have been
enabled to bear it. But daily I must struggle and pray for
resignation; it is a cruel pain and one that will last years, as I
know but too well.</p>

</p></div>

<p>Amongst the last letters from the Grand Duchess is one written on the
6th of December, instructing Prince Ernest’s new tutor in his duties.
Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_380" id="page_380">{380}</a></span> Alice wished her son to become a truly good man in every sense
of the word&mdash;upright, truthful, courageous, unselfish, ready to help
others, modest and retiring. She wished his tutor to encourage in him
fear of God and submission to His will, a high sense of duty, a feeling
of honor and of truth.</p>

<p>It had been settled that as soon as the convalescent patients were able
to be moved, the whole Grand Ducal family should go to Heidelberg for
thorough change of air.</p>

<p>On the 7th of December the Grand Duchess went to the railway station to
see the Duchess of Edinburgh, who was passing through Darmstadt on her
way to England. That night she first complained of feeling ill; and on
the following morning the unmistakable symptoms of diphtheria had begun
to show themselves. It is supposed that she must have taken the
infection, when one day, in her grief and despair, she had laid her head
on her sick husband’s pillow. During the first day of her illness she
settled several things, and gave various orders in case of her death.
Still it was evident that she thought she would recover.</p>

<p>She bore her great sufferings with wonderful patience, and was most
obedient to every thing the doctors ordered her to do, however painful
and trying. Those were terrible days! How much so to her is apparent
from short sentences which from time to time she wrote down on slips of
paper. Every thing was done to alleviate her sufferings<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_381" id="page_381">{381}</a></span>&mdash;every thing to
encourage her. The high fever which set in at the commencement of the
illness did not decrease on the third day as in the previous cases,
though her sufferings were perhaps not so great. At times she was very
restless and distressed. In the night of the 12th of December she gave
many directions to her mother-in-law, and to her lady-in-waiting. At
times, too, she spoke in the most touching manner about her household,
also enquiring kindly after poor and sick people in the town. Then
followed hours of great prostration.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 13th of December the doctors could no longer
disguise from the Grand Duke that their efforts to save that beloved
life were in vain. As the danger increased, the Grand Duchess expressed
herself as feeling better. She received her mother-in-law that afternoon
in the most affectionate manner; also saw her lady-in-waiting; and when
the Grand Duke entered her room her joy was most evident. She even read
two letters&mdash;the last one being from her mother. After some hours of
heavy sleep she woke perfectly conscious and took some nourishment. She
then composed herself to rest, saying: “Now I will go to sleep again.”
And out of this sleep she woke no more.</p>

<p>Shortly after 1 <small>A.M.</small> on the 14th of December a change took place which
left no doubt to those around that that precious life was fast ebbing
away. When, a little later on, Princess Charles went into the Grand
Duke’s room, who was then asleep, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_382" id="page_382">{382}</a></span> had left the Grand Duchess
perfectly unconscious. It required no words of his mother’s to break the
news to him.</p>

<p>At half-past eight that morning Princess Alice died peacefully,
murmuring to herself, like a child going to sleep: “From Friday to
Saturday&mdash;four weeks&mdash;May&mdash;dear Papa&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>It was exactly to the day four weeks since Princess May’s death, and
seventeen years since the death of the Prince Consort. On the following
Tuesday evening, the 17th of December, after a solemn service held by
the English chaplain, the remains of the beloved Princess were quietly
removed from her own palace to the chapel in the Grand Ducal Castle. The
next day, amidst the universal grief of high and low, the coffin was
placed in the Mausoleum at the Rosenhöhe. Her brothers, the Prince of
Wales and Prince Leopold, were present.</p>

<p>A beautiful recumbent monument by Boehm, representing the Princess
holding Princess May in her arms, is now placed in the Mausoleum over
the spot where she rests.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUDING_REMARKS" id="CONCLUDING_REMARKS"></a>

 CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">W</span>E must leave it to those who have read the preceding pages&mdash;mere
chronicle of facts as they are, to form their own idea of the character
and personality of the Princess.</p>

<p>Still, the disjointed manner in which the whole subject has been treated
seems to call for a few more additional remarks.</p>

<p>The world has long been acquainted with the outward appearance of the
Princess&mdash;with the delicacy of her features, the sweetness of their
expression, and the dignity and gracefulness of her every movement.
Though so perfectly natural and simple in manner, she never forgot that
she was a Princess. While she knew how to encourage and draw out those
who, from timidity, kept themselves in the background, she also
understood how, in a moment, to check any thing like forwardness, and,
where necessary, to silence presumption by a glance.</p>

<p>Her conversation was bright and animated, passing rapidly from topic to
topic, but always directed to subjects worth talking about. There was a
certain distinction in the way she dealt even with minor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_384" id="page_384">{384}</a></span> matters of
daily life. She spoke German with a slightly foreign accent, but with a
power of idiomatic expression that seldom failed her, and showed how
thoroughly she had mastered the genius of the language.</p>

<p>Occupation was a necessity to her; she could not understand how any one
could be idle. When at home, she always had some needlework at hand
ready to take up.</p>

<p>The Princess was singularly free from all prejudice, and always
endeavored to judge people according to their worth.</p>

<p>It sometimes happened that she offended people by her independent views,
but she never knowingly hurt anybody’s feelings; innate generosity was a
striking trait in her character.</p>

<p>Frank and sincere herself to an unusual degree, she always encouraged
others to be the same, and was most tolerant of well-grounded
contradiction.</p>

<p>In times of trouble and danger, when so much was expected of her, her
powers seemed to expand. It was in such moments that she really showed
the master-spirit, which remains calm and self-possessed when all around
lose their heads.</p>

<p>The Princess took the deepest interest in the personal welfare of all
around her, even to the humblest of her servants. This interest was
shown by many small services, seldom rendered to their servants by
masters or mistresses.</p>

<p>With all her appreciation of the purely theoretical<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_385" id="page_385">{385}</a></span> and scientific
aspect of things, she was naturally of a very practical turn of mind.
She had few equals in her love and talent for organizing, for
communicating her own ideas to those around her, and in turn being
animated by the views of others. Thus it was that she expected not a
little from those about her, and might almost have given the impression
of a very restless nature, had not this activity been counterbalanced by
an unceasing perseverance in carrying out and adhering to what she had
once undertaken.</p>

<p>To become acquainted with great men of every profession, whether
scholars, artists, or men of science, was a real pleasure to her. She
loved to gain an insight into their thoughts and views, and proved
herself a very German in her admiration and appreciation of serious
scientific work.</p>

<p>Among the arts, music and painting were those she loved the best, and
cultivated the most. In both she was far ahead of even distinguished
amateurs. Her drawing was free, firm, and bold; she had a decided talent
for composition, and was rich in inventive power. She had a wonderful
eye for color, and was especially successful in water-colors.</p>

<p>She was an excellent musician, and played extremely well. Few could read
and understand difficult pieces at sight as the Princess did. In music,
as in all the arts, her taste was rather severe. She had a great
predilection for the classical school. Bach, Beethoven, and Schumann,
Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Brahams were her especial favorites.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_386" id="page_386">{386}</a></span></p>

<p>In theatrical performances she disliked empty show and splendor&mdash;the
mere decoration of pieces for the love of decoration. She believed in
the ennobling influence of the representation of sound classical works.</p>

<p>Her whole being mentally and morally was concentrated in her children
and their education, and in this she showed herself to be a thorough
woman. She endeavored to make them feel the worth and greatness of both
the nations to which they belonged by birth. She was apt to be more
severe in her criticisms of the German mode of education and of moral
training than of that of her own country. That this should have been so
is easily to be explained. In Germany her life and work were not easy,
and she knew that it would take time before her endeavors for the
welfare of her adopted country met with recognition, whilst in England,
the country of her birth and her affection, to which she clung with
ever-increasing reverence and devotion, she knew she was ever becoming
more beloved.</p>

<p>Still, being so thoroughly English as she was, we cannot but say that
much that was best and finest in her character must be considered as the
inheritance of her German father. A nature such as the Princess’ could
not help coming in contact with many deep and serious questions, in
which religion alone could help her.</p>

<p>The traces of perfect trust in God, and entire submission to His will,
will be found throughout her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_387" id="page_387">{387}</a></span> letters. We know that at one time she
wavered in her convictions. Although she never doubted the value of
practical religion, although she ever turned to her Bible for help and
comfort in hours of distress and anxiety, she had to wrestle heart and
soul with theoretical doubts. It seems to have been a struggle of many
years’ duration, at the commencement and end of which personal
influences played a great part.</p>

<p>We are indebted to an intimate friend and relation of Princess Alice’s
for the following communication, which is in accord with the
observations of others who knew her:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“After her son’s death I thought I observed a change in her
feelings. Before that time she had often expressed openly her
doubts as to the existence of God&mdash;had allowed herself to be led
away by the free-thinking philosophical views of others. After
Prince Fritz died she never spoke in such a way again. She remained
silent while a transformation was quietly going on within, of which
I afterwards was made aware, under the influence of some hidden
power. It seemed as if she did not then like to own the change that
had come over her.</p>

<p>“Some time afterwards she told me herself, in the most simple and
touching manner, how this change had come about. I could not listen
to her story without tears. The Princess told me she owed it all to
her child’s death, and to the influence of a Scotch gentleman, a
friend of the Grand Duke’s and the Grand Duchess’, who was residing
with his family at Darmstadt.</p>

<p>“<span class="lftspc">‘</span>I owe all to this kind friend,’ she said, ‘who exercised such a
beneficial influence on my religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_388" id="page_388">{388}</a></span> views; yet people say so much
that is cruel and unjust of him, and of my acquaintance with him.’
At another time she said: ‘The whole edifice of philosophical
conclusions which I had built up for myself, I find to have no
foundation whatever; nothing of it is left; it has crumbled away
like dust. What should we be, what would become of us, if we had no
faith, if we did not believe that there is a God who rules the
world and each single one of us? I feel the necessity of prayer; I
loved to sing hymns with my children, and we have each our favorite
hymn.’<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>“I remember observing that her table in her room was covered with
religious books of all languages. Some of them she recommended to
me.”</p></div>

<p>The German Protestant form of worship did not satisfy her. Her own
English liturgy, with its fine simple prayers and benedictions, with its
many appointed lessons from Holy Writ&mdash;the old Testament
especially,&mdash;with its sermons confined to a limited time, pleased her
more. At the same time she always acknowledged with gratitude and
admiration that the great spiritual hero who was the first to demand as
a right absolute sincerity in the life of faith, and so brought on the
Reformation, was a German.</p>

<p>The Princess had a very wide knowledge of history. Her political
opinions were independent, entirely free from party prejudice, and based
on the principle she had imbibed from her father&mdash;that Princes exist for
the welfare of their people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_389" id="page_389">{389}</a></span></p>

<p>Future generations must ever acknowledge how the Princess Alice
throughout her life strove to fulfil the saying of her favorite hero in
history, “the great Fritz” (Frederic the Great, in his
“Anaimachiavell”): “The rulers of nations must set the example of virtue
to the world.”</p>

 APPENDIX.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE beautiful sketch which follows appeared in the <i>Darmstädter
Zeitung</i>, dated “Christmas Eve, 1878”; and the annexed translation of
it, by Sir Theodore Martin, appeared a few days afterward in the
<i>Times</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="c"><a name="A_WATCHER_BY_THE_DEAD" id="A_WATCHER_BY_THE_DEAD"></a>A WATCHER BY THE DEAD.</p>

<p>Long, long before daybreak on one of those gloomy December days of
last week, an officer made his way hurriedly along the empty,
silent streets of the capital. He was in full uniform, but its pomp
and splendor were shrouded in a thick covering of crape, for he was
afoot thus early to do duty by the bier of the beloved Princess.
Desolate were the streets, as of a city of the dead; desolate as
though tenanted only by the dead was the lordly palace to which he
bent his steps. The sentinels at the great gate stood motionless,
despite the severe cold, as if they feared to disturb the repose of
death. Here, where the inhabitants of the capital used to see all
astir with the busy, cheerful life inseparable from the residence
of a reigning Prince; here, where in days but recently gone by
children, blooming and beautiful, the country’s pride and the joy
of their princely parents, gave animation to house and garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_392" id="page_392">{392}</a></span> all
was silent and void; a deadly blast had swept over the till now so
happy home. The country’s young, idolized mother had closed her
beautiful eyes, closed them for evermore, after doing and enduring
nobly, after tasting the bitterness of great earthly sorrow. Many
long and woful days, many nights of even greater anguish, had she
watched, trembled, and prayed by the couch of a husband sick unto
death, and of five children beloved past telling. The sweet,
youngest bud in the fair wreath of princely children, had been torn
from her bleeding heart, and tears&mdash;scalding tears&mdash;for the sweet
little May-blossom, which she had herself put to its last sleep
under chaplets of flowers, flowed fast, as she folded her hands in
gratitude, when the peril of death had passed over the heads of her
husband and her other children. “Thus do we learn humility!” she
said, with quivering lip, to a lady who stood beside her. “God has
called for one life, and has given me back five for it; how, then,
should I mourn?” And now, when, with fear and trembling, joy seemed
about to enter once more into that heavily-stricken home, again the
dark pinions of the Angel of Death were heard upon the air, and he
bore away the truest of wives, the most loving of mothers, a
sacrifice to duty fulfilled with the noblest forgetfulness of self.
These were the thoughts with which the solitary wayfarer went upon
his sorrowful way, and crossed the threshold of the chamber of
death. With light step and whispered words the watchers by the dead
whom he relieved withdrew.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by the majesty of death, which met him here in its most
sombre form, the new comer bent his head and continued long in
silent prayer. The Princess lay on a bier in the great hall on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_393" id="page_393">{393}</a></span>
ground-floor, where she had so often sat surrounded by a radiant
circle of guests. What of her was earthly, cased in a triple
cerement, was covered with a pall of black velvet, which, however,
was almost hid from view beneath a mass of flowers and palms. Upon
the head of the coffin stood a little, simple crucifix of perfect
artistic workmanship. Six torches on pedestals, hung with black,
stood round the bier, shedding but a feeble glimmer through the
hall, scarcely brighter, indeed, than the scanty light of the
dawning winter day. From the wall opposite the coffin the youthful
image of her husband, painted in happier times, looked sadly down
upon the loved one lost. Directly opposite hung the picture which
the Hessian Division had had painted for their much-loved leader,
in remembrance of the glorious day of Gravelotte&mdash;a picture of
battle and of the wild <i>mêlée</i> of slaughter in the silent chamber
of death. He who now watched by the coffin had played a part in the
conflict of the memorable day which the picture was meant to
perpetuate, and he knew how deeply it was interwoven with the life
of the Princess who lay there in her long last sleep. Her dear
husband had gone to the campaign with his faithful Hessians; she
knew his precious life to be in hourly danger; but her own sorrows
and cares were not her first thought. Helpful, comforting,
encouraging, she gave at all times to those who were left behind a
brilliant example of cheerful and devoted courage; and when the
wounded and sick came back from the battlefields in ever-increasing
numbers, she it was who everywhere took the lead with noblest
self-abnegation and practical good sense. By the beds of the sick
and dying she stood like a comforting angel, and the love of the
Hessian<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_394" id="page_394">{394}</a></span> people twined the fairest of all diadems, the aureole of
the heroine, round her princely brows.</p>

<p>This grateful love, not only of those who bore arms, but of the
citizen and artisan as well, for which these things laid the
foundation, was now sincerely and unconstrainedly busy beside the
bier of the princely sleeper. Servants came, with loads of wreaths
and bouquets, and arranged them upon the coffin. But it was not the
official tributes of flowers from Court and noble, from the
deputations of regiments far and near, which were laid as a
mournful homage at the feet of the dead mistress, that touched most
deeply the heart of him who stood there on guard. No, the tear that
stole down unbidden, the little trivial gift of the poor and humble
who lived far away from Court favor, had a greater value in his
eyes. It was still quite early morning when, with the first glimmer
of day, came an old peasant woman from the Odenwald. Advancing
timidly, she laid, with a murmured prayer, a little wreath of
rosemary, with a couple of small white flowers, perhaps the only
ornament of her poor little room at home, as a token of grateful
affection down upon the velvet pall. Then, thinking herself
unnoticed, she took a rosebud from one of the splendid wreaths, and
hid it under the old woollen dress. Who could interfere to balk the
impulse of genuine affection, that longed to carry off some slight
memorial with it? And now the little flower is lying between the
leaves of the old Bible, and in days to come the matron, when she
turns the leaves of the sacred volume, will tell her daughters and
granddaughters of the noble lady, too early snatched away from her
people&mdash;of her, who never forgot the poorest and the humblest of
them all.</p>

<p>Anon appeared the bearer of one of the proudest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_395" id="page_395">{395}</a></span> names in Hesse,
who was attached to the personal service of the Princess. The
official, stalwart bearing of the courier was left outside, and,
weeping hot, unhidden tears, he lingered long by the bier. To what
a lofty soul, to what goodness of heart, was he saying here a
bitter farewell! He was followed by two little girls, poorly but
cleanly dressed, and they, too, brought their tribute of
gratitude&mdash;two little bunches of violets. Shyly, almost frightened,
and yet with childish curiosity, they drew slowly nearer. They
thought of another winter day, some years ago. Hungry, chilled to
the heart, they were sitting in an empty attic; their parents were
dead, and they ate among strangers bread that was hard and
grudgingly given, when that great lady appeared who was now
sleeping here under the flowers. From her, whose heart was ever
yearning to the orphan’s cry, they heard again, for the first time,
gentle, loving words; by her provision was quickly made for their
more kindly treatment, and gratitude was rooted firmly and forever
in their young souls.</p>

<p>A deputation from the Court Theatre laid upon the coffin a wreath
intertwined with pale pink streamers. Art, too, had come to mourn
for her noblest patroness, who had been ever ready with her fine,
cultivated intelligence to advance whatever was great and good. A
servant brought a beautiful cross, of dark foliage with white
flowers. It was the gift of the Grand Duke’s mother, anxious to
testify by an outward sign her love for her dead daughter. In
ever-growing numbers came the mourners, all visibly oppressed by
the weight of the calamity which had fallen upon the country.
Countless were the gifts of love, of gratitude, of respect, which,
now beautiful and costly, now slight and simple, arched<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_396" id="page_396">{396}</a></span> ever
higher and higher the hill of flowers above the coffin. The ladies
of the neighboring towns sent cushions of dark violets, with
chaplets of white flowers. Two ladies deeply veiled brought
branches of palm, from the dark green of which gleamed a white
scroll&mdash;a poetic farewell word of deep feeling:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A hurricane, charged with destruction,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O palm, swept o’er thee. The squall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crashed through thy leaves, and tore from thee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tenderest, sweetest of all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The clouds clear’d away in the distance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The tempest seem’d over and past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When forth from the firmament darted<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lightning-bolt, fiery and fast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It struck thee, O noble one, struck thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It crush’d thee, and now thou art gone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell! To our death-day thine image<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still, still in our hearts shall live on.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">There was a second poem, enclosed in a heart-shaped framework of
leaves, which gave expression to the grief of a devoted soul for
the high-hearted lady.</p>

<p>But now the hour was come for another to take the post of honor by
the bier of the Princess. Silently and sadly the two men saluted.
He that left took away with him a deep and elevating impression of
the general love and respect paid by the people of Hesse to their
too-early departed Princess, and the remembrance of that silent
watch by the dead will remain in his memory forever. And he who now
entered on that honorable duty could chronicle proofs of genuine
grief, of true reverence and love, not fewer nor less touching.
Whosoever is thus bewept has secured the best and fairest memorial
in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_397" id="page_397">{397}</a></span> hearts of her own people for all time&mdash;“The remembrance of
the just abideth in blessing.”</p></div>

<p>Nothing could show better than this touching narrative, how deep and how
widespread was the grief for the death of the Princess throughout the
country which had so recently hailed her as its Sovereign. Not less deep
and universal was the sorrow with which the sad intelligence was
received in her native land. She had long been dear to all hearts there;
for the fame of her many admirable qualities as daughter, sister, wife,
and mother had penetrated into every household. The news that her life
was in peril had awakened the deepest sympathy; and when the anniversary
of the death of the father she loved so well brought the tidings of her
own death, there were few homes on which it did not cast a shadow as for
the loss of one that was personally dear. The journals teemed with
expressions of the national grief, each vying with the other in paying
affectionate tribute to the worth of one whose name had long been
familiar and cherished on the lips of her countrymen and countrywomen,
and in assurances of sympathy to the Queen, and the loving hearts of her
kindred, on whom this great calamity had fallen.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to insert here, as an example of these, what
was written out of a full heart on the day of the Princess’ death by the
hand which had not yet concluded the task of tracing the “Life of the
Prince Consort,” in which the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_398" id="page_398">{398}</a></span> had all along taken the keenest
interest. The letters printed in this volume afford the amplest proof of
the justice of the estimate which the writer had formed of the gifted
and devoted woman whose heart is there laid bare for our study and
instruction.</p>

December 14th, 1878.<br />
</p>

<p>On the 14th of December, seventeen years ago, a great sorrow fell
upon England in the death of the Prince Consort, who, if he did not
die too soon for his own happiness and fame, died at least, as all
now feel, too soon for England. The memorable 14th of December has
again come round, and again a great sorrow has fallen upon the
country. The Princess has been taken to her rest, who watched and
soothed the Prince Consort in the last days of his fatal illness,
and who by her fortitude and noble devotion helped materially,
though then but a girl of seventeen, to sustain and comfort the
widowed Queen in her measureless affliction. For the first time a
breach&mdash;and such a breach&mdash;has been made in that family circle to
which all who had the priviledge to know it looked as the happiest
in England&mdash;happiest, because mutual love and esteem bound all its
members together by ties knit in childhood and never broken, and
because of the noble activity for good which had been set before
them in the example of their parents kept their hearts fresh and
their minds ever open. She who, while yet a girl, was called to
play a woman’s part by her father’s deathbed, has been the first to
follow him into the Silent Land.</p>

<p>No life could have opened more auspiciously than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_399" id="page_399">{399}</a></span> that of the
second daughter of our Royal house.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> From the first she gave
great promise of beauty and of intelligence. The fine old English
names of Alice and Maud, selected for her by her happy parents,
seemed as names sometimes do, to be particularly fitted to the
winning, open character of her fair and finely-formed features, and
their sound was one pleasant in the mouths, not only of those to
whom she was known, but of the people, as she grew up and was seen
in public by the eager and kindly eyes to whom the sight of the
Royal children has always been welcome.</p>

<p>When the marriage of the Princess Royal took place in 1858, the
Princess Alice was still only a girl of fifteen; but she had
already developed qualities of mind and heart of no ordinary kind.
She came by degrees to fill up in some measure the vacancy which
had been created by the removal of her very gifted sister to
Berlin. Naturally she was drawn nearer to the Prince Consort; and
the influence of his character and the teachings of his
affectionate wisdom sank deeply into her pure and highly
intellectual nature. He looked forward to her future with the
assurance that she would prove all he could wish a daughter to be.
She, on the other hand, loved him with a devotion only tempered by
a profound reverence for the great qualities which she could then,
perhaps, but dimly appreciate, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_400" id="page_400">{400}</a></span> true extent and worth of
which her own subsequent experience and reflection taught her more
thoroughly to measure. When in later years she spoke of the Prince,
one saw that, as Ben Jonson said of Shakespeare, “she honored his
memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any.”</p>

<p>The teaching of that beloved father was put to the proof in those
sad days of patient watching which preceded his death. Things were
told at the time of the devotion and the marvellous self-control of
the young girl, called so sternly and so suddenly to face death in
the person of a father, on whose life that of the Queen herself
seemed to depend, and whose counsels she knew to be of inestimable
value to the nation. A few days after the Prince’s death, she was
spoken of by the <i>Times</i> in these noticeable words: “Of the
devotion and strength of mind shown by the Princess Alice all
through these trying scenes it is impossible to speak too highly.
Her Royal Highness has, indeed, felt that it was her place to be a
comfort and a support to her mother in her affliction, and to her
dutiful care we may perhaps owe it that the Queen has borne her
loss with exemplary resignation, and a composure which, under so
sudden and terrible a bereavement, could not have been
anticipated.” The knowledge of this fact&mdash;and it was a fact&mdash;sank
deeply into people’s minds. It was never forgotten, and from that
day the name of the Princess Alice has been a cherished household
word to all her countrymen and women.</p>

<p>When, in 1862, she married the husband of her choice&mdash;a man whose
sterling worth and manliness had satisfied even the critical
judgment of parents jealous for the happiness of a daughter so
justly dear&mdash;the affectionate good wishes of the Queen’s subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_401" id="page_401">{401}</a></span>
of all grades went with her to her new home. In that home,
brightened and ennobled as it was by her presence, her love for the
home and country of her youth burned with a steady and
ever-deepening glow. It is only those who know how strong is the
mutual love by which the children of Queen Victoria are bound to
their parent and to each other, who can appreciate the passionate
yearning toward England of the Princesses whose homes have been
made elsewhere. England and all its interests held a foremost place
in the heart of the Princess Alice; and no one watched more closely
every phase of the changeful life of the busy land, which she loved
and reverenced as the home of liberty and the pioneer of
civilization.</p>

<p>While fulfilling with exemplary devotion every duty as a wife and
mother, the process of self-culture was never relaxed. Every
refined taste was kept alive by fresh study, fresh practice, fresh
observation; neither was any effort spared to keep abreast with all
that the best intellects of the time were adding to the stores of
invention, of discovery, of observation, and of thought. Each
successive year taught her better to estimate the value of the
principles in religion, in morals, and in politics in which she had
been trained. As her knowledge of the world and of men grew, she
could see the wide range of fact upon which they were based, and
their fitness as guides amid the perplexing experiences of human
life, which, however seemingly varied in different epochs, are ever
essentially the same. Then the significance of the Prince Consort’s
habit of judging every thing by some governing principle, and
working always by strict method, became clear to her; and in a
letter written in January 1875, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_402" id="page_402">{402}</a></span> which a copy is before us, the
Princess writes with her accustomed modesty: “Living with thinking
and cultivated Germans, much in Papa has explained itself to me,
which formerly I could less understand, or did not appreciate so
much as I ought to have done.”</p>

<p>She inherited much of her father’s practical good sense, and, like
him, was ever ready to take part in any well-directed effort for
raising the condition of the toilworn and the poor. How much of
their misery, nay, of their evil ways, was due to their wretched
habitations, she, like him, felt most keenly; and she gave her
sympathy and support to every effort for their improvement. With
this view she translated into German some of Miss Octavia Hill’s
essays “On the Homes of the London Poor,” and published them with a
little preface of her own (to which only her initial A. was
affixed), in the hope that the principles, which had been
successfully applied in London by Miss Hill and her coadjutors,
might be put into action in some of the German cities. No good work
appealed to her in vain. The great exemplar of her father was
always before her; and in the letter from which we have already
quoted she speaks of his life, “spent in the highest aims, and with
the noblest conception of duty,” as a “leading star” to her own.</p>

<p>That sense of duty carried her to the bedside of the Prince of
Wales when, at the end of 1871, he was struck down at Sandringham
by the fell disease under which his father had sunk. There she
fulfilled the same priceless offices which she had ten years before
discharged at Windsor Castle. It pleased Heaven to spare her a
renewal of the great affliction of 1861; and in the very days of
December in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_403" id="page_403">{403}</a></span> we are now living, the life of the much-loved
brother, which had been wellnigh despaired of, came slowly back to
requite her affection, and in answer to her prayers.</p>

<p>The trials of that time came, before the exhaustion had passed away
both of body and mind which the Princess had undergone during the
Franco-German war. Separated&mdash;and for the second time&mdash;by war from
the Prince of Hesse, who was away in the thickest of the perils of
that campaign, she was not a woman to give herself up to morbid
brooding on the pangs and apprehensions under which, devoted wife
as she was, she yet could not fail to suffer most acutely, for her
feelings were warm, and her imagination active beyond that of most
women. In the hospital at Darmstadt, crowded with the soldiers,
French as well as German, who had come from the battlefields maimed
and racked with pain, she was foremost with her bright
intelligence, her helpful sympathy, and her tender hand, in
soothing pain, and inspiring that sense of manly gratitude which is
the best of panaceas to a soldier’s sick-bed. What she was and what
she did at that time have embalmed her image in many a heart, and
will make the tears flow thick and fast in many manly eyes at the
thought of the death of one so young, so good, so gifted, and so
fair. To her it was merely duty&mdash;duty to be done at every cost; but
how much it had cost to that finely touched spirit and to that
delicate womanly frame might be read, by all who could look below
the surface, in the deep earnestness of her eyes and the deeper
earnestness of her thoughts. The pain of that terrible period would
not let itself be forgotten even in the gratitude which she felt
for the providence which restored her beloved husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_404" id="page_404">{404}</a></span> to her side,
and for the realization of her father’s cherished dream of an
United Germany, which had been purchased by the valor and the
sufferings of its sons.</p>

<p>The Princess’ fortitude had already been severely tried in the war
between Prussia and Austria in 1866. Hesse-Darmstadt was engaged
upon the side of Austria, and her husband, Prince Louis, took the
field with the troops of the Principality. At the very time that
his third daughter, the Princess Irène, was born, he was with the
army; and the Princess Alice knew he was under fire but was unable
to get any tidings from him. The victorious Prussians marched into
Darmstadt, while the Princess, newly made a mother, was still
confined to her room.</p>

<p>Of the sad aspects of life it had been her destiny to see much&mdash;as
daughter, as sister, and as mother. In June, 1873, a terrible
calamity fell upon her as a mother. A child&mdash;one especially
beloved&mdash;climbing to an open window in a room adjoining that in
which she was, lost its balance, and was killed almost before her
eyes, as she rushed in terror to call him back. This, too, had to
be borne. It was borne nobly, and with Christian resignation. But
such shocks tell upon the vital powers, and some trace of what had
been “undergone and overcome” seemed to be visible long afterward
in a perceptible bodily languor, and in a more spiritual beauty
which had passed into her expressive face.</p>

<p>The thought of this sent an anxious thrill through the hearts of
many, when it became known that the Princess was herself seized by
the terrible malady which had prostrated her husband and five of
her children, and taken from her the youngest of them all&mdash;the
youngest, the brightest, the idol of her other<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_405" id="page_405">{405}</a></span> children.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> She
had nursed them all through their time of danger, and now, spent
with watching and anxiety as she was, the malady had laid its fatal
clutch upon herself. She that had cared and thought for all was
soon past all human care to save. Thus she died as she had lived,
devoted, self-sacrificing, purified by great pain and great love&mdash;a
model daughter&mdash;wife&mdash;mother.</p>

<p>Of the loss of such a woman to the husband to whom she was the
all-in-all, to the children to whose love she will respond no more,
to the mother in whose thoughts she is interwoven with the
sweetest, the saddest, the most sacred memories, to the brothers
and sisters whom she loved and who loved her so truly, so tenderly,
who dare trust himself to speak? It must be long before the grief
can be assuaged, under which all these must now be
suffering&mdash;before the “Idea of her life can sweetly creep,” as
something hallowed, “into their study of imagination”; but the day
will come when they will bless God, that theirs was a wife, a
daughter, a sister, a mother, so good, so noble, and that, having
fought her fight on earth valiantly, yet meekly, she has gone where
there is no more sorrow, nor crying, and where the great mysteries
of life alone find their solution.</p>

patience, and an unselfish and even cheerful spirit which were truly
admirable. The day before she died, she expressed to Sir William Jenner
her regret that she should cause her mother so much anxiety.</p></div>
